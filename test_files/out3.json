RO can suffer from high operational problems (due to fouling of the RO membranes) and challenges to control the fouling risk during pre-treatment. This PhD research focuses on biofouling, which is the main concern in RO systems due to the deposition and growth of microorganisms on the membrane surface, eventually leading to increase in head loss across the feed spacer of spiral wound elements and to the decrease of permeability of the RO membranes.\r\nTo date, there are no standard methods to assess the risk of biofouling of RO feedwater. Basic understanding of this phenomenon shows that nutrient concentration in the membrane feedwater is a key parameter. Two other parameters are also considered to have a major impact on biofouling: the occurrence of algal blooms in the raw seawater (and their impact on the pre-treatment line) and the type of bacterial population active in the RO feedwater. \r\nThis research aims at further developing a bacterial growth potential method for assessing biofouling in SWRO and attempting to correlate this method with RO operation. In addition, the research will aim at identifying (with metagenomics) the bacterial populations and specific strains that could be responsible for biofouling in SWRO membranes.\r\nA combination of laboratory work, piloting and monitoring of three full-scale desalination plants suffering of biofouling at various levels will be part of the study. Besides the general water quality parameters including nutrients monitoring, two innovative analyses will be conducted: metagenomics and bacterial growth potential based on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and flow-cytometry measurements (FCM).", "date_created": "2021-06-15 11:47:22 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-31 16:19:49 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 13, "answered_questions": 2}}, {"id": 71457, "grant_number": null, "title": "PWE research - renewal of heat supply system in Passewaaij 7, Tiel", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Marjolein Bouwmeester"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Marjolein Bouwmeester"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-02-13 10:07:44 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-03-17 07:11:22 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 84852, "grant_number": null, "title": "Robert's Plan", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-09-25 12:19:40 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-09-25 12:19:40 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 69854, "grant_number": null, "title": "The measurement of hand range of motion (ROM)", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": ""}, "data_contact": {"info": "Helen Yuan"}, "description": "The goal of this study is to measure three ranges of motion (ROM) of all the fingers to investigate the relations among the three ROMs. The three ranges are active range of motion (AROM), passive range of motion (PROM), and functional range of motion (FROM). \r\nThe measurement is based on an optical tracking system, consists of  GoPro cameras and paper markers.

This research project adopts an actor-centred perspective and is specifically interested in the role collective and individual actors play in promoting sustainability and the different behaviours and strategies they employ to foster sustainable urban development. On the one hand, the project aims to clarify the transformative power of individuals (such as administrators, politicians and citizens) to initiate change in planning processes. On the other hand, the project is interested in the practices within organisations in the field of urban and regional planning (such as planning departments or city developers) to support sustainable development.\r\n\r\nAgency is particularly important when urban development does not follow linear procedures but unfolds in multi-dimensional and multi-scalar projects and processes. Against the background of social and political fragmentation, rapid technological change and complex global networks, a shift from formalised government-led development to informal governance arrangements can be observed in urban planning. Better knowledge about the role of actors is needed to understand how abstract and ubiquitous objectives like sustainability are operationalised through specific policies and concrete interventions in the built environment. By clarifying the role of collective and individual agency in the governance of sustainable urban development, the project aims to analyse and conceptualise the links between administrative contexts (planning systems), institutional norms (planning cultures) and spatial outcomes (planning practices). \r\nThe project investigates the application of the EU Urban Innovative Actions initiative in two countries (Finland and the Netherlands) and combines two research methods (Q methodology and expert interviews).

The biopolymers are obtained via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), in particular, using the Aerobic Granular Sludge (AGS) technology. The AGS purification systems are currently commercialized under the trade mark Nereda\u00ae and have spread all over the globe, with about 70 locations. The production yield, structure, and properties of this AGS-derived biopolymer can be tuned by modifying the environment of the microorganisms. This project aims to investigate the environmental and metabolic influences on the biopolymer, including process optimization. With regards application, properties of the biopolymer nanocomposites are influenced by the polymer structure, amount and type of nanofiller, interactions etc. Several operational factors will be studied via changes in the bioprocess environment, e.g. temperature, agitation, aeration, solids retention time, pH, and salinity, to modify biopolymer characteristics like molar mass and chemical structure. The resulting biopolymer structure specifically influences the properties of the final nanocomposite material, for instance stiffness, strength and toughness, providing novel technological applications. In turn, the obtained structure-property relations of the biomaterials will provide guidance on the polymer characteristics required for product development. The alginate-like exopolymer is price competitive due to the negative value of the raw resource, i.e., the waste granular sludge from Nereda\u00ae installations. The expected production of exopolymer is an order of magnitude larger than the global alginate market. Currently, industry and academia are putting great efforts into the development of such AGS-derived biopolymer. The alginate-like material has recently been named Kaumera Nereda\u00ae Gum. Our previous interdisciplinary research demonstrated unexpected properties of the developed nanocomposites, providing a sensible route for producing and applying new biomaterials in a circular economy. The combination of our expertise in environmental biotechnology and the structure-property relations of complex hybrid polymer materials we believe provides a unique opportunity for rapid development of commercially-viable and nature-inspired designer biomaterials derived from wastewater.\r\n\r\nDuring the Nanocycle project, the PhD students intensively exchange information in order to optimize an integrated production chain from wastewater to purified biomaterial (Kaumera).

These stressors are part of the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) factors, which are thermal comfort, lighting quality, acoustical quality, and air quality, that are playing a vital role in human comfort and health. \r\nStudents spend the majority of their time in educational buildings and their homes. Previous studies have shown that a large number of students are bothered by noise in the classroom. Background noise has a negative impact on human physiological health, mental health and performance.  A strong relationship has been found between optimal acoustical design and scholar achievement. Most of the previous studies focused on quantifying parameters and evaluating the indicators of the IEQ-factors rather than studying the preferences and needs of individuals. Interactions of stressors at and between human and environmental levels in different soundscapes were not accounted for. Furthermore, previous studies focused on the adverse effects of the acoustical environment despite the effects of the positive soundscapes in enhancing the well-being of individuals. Therefore, to create a good indoor acoustical quality, there is a need to assess IEQ with an integrated analysis approach taken into account the acoustical preferences and needs of each individual as well as understanding how the soundscape approach can improve the well-being of students in different indoor soundscapes.\r\nThus, the main question of this study is how can the indoor soundscape be optimized to fulfil the acoustical preferences and needs of different students? Accordingly, this study aims at developing optimal solution(s) that satisfy the acoustical preferences and needs of different student profiles and enhance their well-being in various indoor soundscapes. According to that, a number of methods will be conducted which are: 1) literature review for Identify key indicators, tools, and methods for evaluating acoustical preferences and needs in indoor soundscapes; 2) a questionnaire for Identifying student profiles based on their acoustical preferences and needs in indoor soundscapes; 3) experimental study in a lab for examining the relationship between different soundscapes and the well-being (physiological and psychological health) of each students\u2019 profile through physiological measurements, subjective assessment, and semi-structured interview; 4) simulation for Implementing valid and optimal solution(s) that fulfil the acoustical preferences and needs as well as promoting the well-being of each student profile in indoor soundscapes.

A major challenge for cognitive agents, e.g., socially assistive robots, that interact with humans is the capability of adapting to highly unpredictable behaviors and responses of humans. \r\n\r\nTo be more specific:\r\n(1) While classical adaptive control methods from control theory provide a strong theoretical background, they mainly rely on model-based approaches, which might be difficult to obtain when humans are involved. AI-based control methodologies, e.g., reinforcement learning, can learn from (initially unknown) environments, including humans, but they often require large training datasets. \r\n(2) Since humans are social beings, another challenge of human-robot interactions is incorporation of \u2018human-like sociability\u2019 in the decisions of socially assistive robots. \r\nTherefore, in this PhD project, we will consider integrated approaches based on classical control theory and AI-based approaches to develop novel decision-making methods that boost the strengths of both approaches. \r\nIn particular, we will focus on fuzzy logic theory and fuzzy-logic-based inference to integrate modeling and inference approaches within the decision-making module of socially assistive robots that mimic the cognition and inferences of humans.  \r\nThe approaches that will be developed in this PhD project will be implemented to socially assistive robots in healthcare.

Another form of AI, evolutionary algorithms, has recently been successfully used for this, outperforming expert-designed architectures.

They do not consider scenarios where learners need to engage in a project-based experiential learning where the learning process tends to be longer and broader in scope and learners learn through active experience and reflection on that experience. The learners need to engage in the searching process for weeks in order to attain the objectives of the project and their goals and research questions might change during the course of their learning journey.

One of the barriers towards a circular construction process, is the fundamentally different approach, concerning reducing waste and dealing responsibly with materials and resources. One of the solutions for construction companies to realize a circular economy, is through the concept of servitization. The research problem is the lack of widely supported knowledge about servitization concepts that contribute circularity in the construction industry. Therefore, the main research question is: <em>To what extent can servitization in the construction industry contribute circularity?</em> The first two research questions: <em>What is servitization?</em> &amp; <em>What is circularity?</em> determine a clear understanding for the construction industry based on literature study. The third research question: <em>What relationships can be found between servitization and circularity?</em> describes relationships between servitization and circularity in general. This research is based on qualitative data from in-depth interviews with experts from the construction industry. The last research question: <em>What servitization concepts contribute circularity in the construction industry? </em>provides widely supported concepts through questionnaires and therewith a generalization for practice.

The study on the value of Chinese urban heritage is also greatly influenced by the defective paradigm.  This dissertation aims to determine how a value system appropriate to Chinese urban heritage is constructed.\r\nHUL (Historic Urban Landscape) is adopted as the research method to construct the value system of Chinese urban heritage. The interpretation of HUL fundamentally reveals  a system approach, which is derived from the holistic mindset of time-space interweaving. When this system approach is associated with the value construct of urban heritage, it is not only the operational application of HUL in the value field, but also indicates how to filter, reflect and reconstruct the existing heritage value theories. So the urban heritage value under construction is a set of structural and evolutionary system rather than a single and static type of value. Finally, the case study on Suzhou is the application and verification of research method and value system.\r\n", "date_created": "2021-09-10 21:18:24 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-09-29 20:47:38 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 27}}, {"id": 74621, "grant_number": null, "title": "TPM MSc: Trade-o\ufb00 to avoid perceived risk of respiratory infection in train commutes: A Stated Choice Experiment study in the Netherlands", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "Public Transport ridership has seen a tremendous fall after the outbreak of COVID-19. It is anticipated that usage of public transport would not go back to pre-COVID times even when the pandemic is over. This is the anticipation for the Netherlands as well. \r\nBefore the outbreak of COVID-19, there have been many researches on valuation of crowding in public transport, but the highest disutility experienced from this crowding in public transport, specially trains, has been witnessed in current times of pandemic. This is so because crowding promotes the spread of Acute respiratory infections such as Coronavirus (SARS, MERS, COVID-19, Influenza). In this study, the indicator for perceived risk of catching an infection while travelling in trains would be crowding levels. This would be measured in terms of seat occupancy and social distancing on-board. Due to government restrictions and fear of catching COVID-19 amongst people, the demand for trains has fallen. But even if the demand during peak hours restores to 25% of pre-COVID-19 times, the capacity in trains with social distancing on-board would not be sufficient to accommodate demand. Government and operators are making changes on supply side. But from demand side, it is important to know if people are willing to change their departure times to avoid crowd in trains. This could help in flattening the peaks of demands. Hence the trade off which respondents would make is crowding levels in two train alternatives and change in departure time from home for catching one of them.\r\nKnowing how these trade-offs vary across different groups of people would be helpful in understanding the variations, and if the survey is representative. Personal questions would include: the age group, gender, income group, any health condition, usual purpose of travel, usual mode of travel. These questions would in Multiple Choice Question format with an option to ''Not Answer a question''. Questions regarding any respondents identity would not be asked. The respondents identity  would remain anonymous.\r\nThis is an important time to reduce congestions and high demand during rush hours.

In literature research there is lack a of knowledge about the utilisation and operation of certified energy-efficiency office buildings, particularly focussing on user organisations and owner organisations.

After analysing the significance of the factors, especially herding behaviour, an agent-based modelling will show the interplay of such social behaviour, enabling policy makers to dynamically predict the aggregate behaviour at the population level. The expected result is a better insight on factors that influence mask-wearing behaviour, putting a high emphasis on herding behaviour, that ultimately leads to a dynamic model that supports the policy makers in designing public health policies.", "date_created": "2021-02-18 16:35:01 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-03-31 11:01:31 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 14}}, {"id": 80372, "grant_number": null, "title": "Analysis of cognitive distortions in suicidal hotline chats", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Marijn ten Thij"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Marijn ten Thij"}, "description": "Depression and suicidal ideation often occur together.

Using a single-subject study design, participants will be asked to collaborate in groups of three members within a virtual, three-dimensional environment. \r\n\r\nParticipants will be wearing VR headsets or \"HMDs\" (Head-Mounted Displays) and use VR-specific controllers to interact with the VE. While inside the VE, participants will be asked to maneuver through a virtual maze containing four different puzzles. The group members will be asked to solve these (non-domain specific) puzzles, of which some do not specifically require collaboration in order to be completed (but might benefit from collaboration nonetheless), while others can only be completed if the group members operate collaboratively.\r\n\r\nFor each group (of three participants), the experiment will take approximately 60 minutes. In total, six groups (of three participants) will be asked to perform the experiment separately (i.e. only one group of three at a time), bringing the total number of participants of this experiment to 18. The intention is to perform all six sessions for each group on a single day (which is expected to take approximately 6 to 7 hours). \r\n\r\nOut of the six groups, three will function as the experimental group (EG) and three as the control group (CG).

The Global Digital Report (2019) showed that internet usage via a mobile device has jumped from 26% in 2014 to 48% in 2019. These technologies are introduced in public transport as well. Observation by Kilincsoy and Vink (2018) observed 48%, and the early study by Udomboonyanupap et al. (2021) observed that 57.4% used a smartphone. \r\nThis growth in the use of mobile computing devices might have comfort and health implications. When people using a smartphone they usually stress their upper body [Groenesteijn et al., 2014]. This could be neck flexion, eye strain, and pain of the shoulder (Honan, 2015). The upper, lower arm, wrist, and fingers could potentially overuse, due to holding the smartphone for a long duration [Honan, 2015]. The head is bent forward when people use a smartphone on the lap, which could increase neck pain comparing to using a smartphone leaning the arms on an armrest resulting in a more upright position of the head. Smartphone use for a long time influence more pain and fatigue, as described by [Kim and Koo, 2016]. \r\nRedesign of the interior of public transport systems like trains might be useful to prevent these problems to some extent. Some studies report even 7 hours of use of mobile devices during the day (Damasceno et al., 2018). Unlike desktop computing, there is not much literature on discomfort and health effects associated with mobile computing use, especially while traveling. However, this does not include data on the workplace design and design of the passenger environment while traveling. For supporting the redesign of vehicle interiors (like trains, cars, and airplanes), more design directions would be helpful based on data like areas affected in the human body, activities performed while using a smartphone, and postures.\r\nThe main goal of this study will design special arm supports, especially for smartphone use. Aim to reduce flex neck angle while passengers are using a smartphone on a long-hour train trip. The 1st research question is how many degrees of flex neck will reduce while using a smartphone in the modified seat compare with the traditional seat? However, reduce of the flexed neck will influence arms fatigue. This study will test the new design of armrests compare with the traditional armrests. The 2nd research question is does the discomfort experienced on the neck while using a smartphone in the modified seat is less than the traditional seat? We need to confirm that a new design of armrest can prevent flex neck and arm fatigue. In addition, a warning system can prevent the passenger from using a smartphone for a long period. The 3rd research question is does the warning system help passengers can reduce their time on the phone? Moreover, the pressure distribution will test a comparison between the 4 different postures of smartphone use in 2 seats. Does the pressure distribution on the seat pan significantly different between 2 seats with the same posture? Does the pressure distribution on the seat pan are different compared to 4 different postures at the same seat? The other research questions will provide. For example, does discomfort experienced on the neck while using a smartphone in the modified seat is lower than the traditional seat? How the difference in comfort experience in each seat part while comparing between the modified seat and traditional seat? Does discomfort experience on the other body parts while using a smartphone in the modified seat is less than the traditional seat? Does the modified seat fulfill your expectation of comfort?

They are often highly urbanised as deltas provide socio-economic and ecologic values. One of the main challenges for societies living in deltas is salt intrusion. This puts significant pressure on the continuous local demand of freshwater used for agricultural, industrial and drinking water purposes. By exposing deltas to accelerated sea level rise and more frequent and more extreme prolonged droughts, climate change is increasingly causing high levels of salt intrusion, threatening the freshwater reserves.\r\n\r\nTo secure the present deltaic values offered by the freshwater reserves, cost-effective measures need to be implemented that aim to limit salt intrusion; these solutions are named SALTISolutions. SALTISolutions aim to strengthen the opportunities for nature development, and to preserve the values or create added value for the society and economy. \r\n\r\nTherefore, possible implications of SALTISolutions on the socio-economic and ecological values have to be assessed in detail and anticipated in the design. One of these is the port logistics. Ports are essential links in the global supply chain on which local societies depend economically. SALTISolutions may significantly degrade the performance of port and waterway networks. This research focuses on the quantification of these implications for port logistics.\r\n\r\nTo date, there are no published generic approaches which are able to design nature-based SALTISolutions that address benefits for and/or preservation of estuarine values, in particular port logistics in relation to eco-morpho-hydrodynamic processes. Furthermore, none of existing simulation models for port logistics are fully open source and are in general heavily adjusted to fit their objectives regarding case studies. Therefore, they lack the ability to be generically applied to various cases and are not flexible to add new modelling concepts.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this research aims to develop an open source, generic, integrated port simulation model, which is able to quantify changes in the operation of ports and waterways networks as a consequence of alterations in estuarine dynamics, and vice versa, to assist policy and decision making in estuary-scale water bodies.

Monopiles have been designed for 20-25 years of operation, but the loading cycles applied in most of the current research are relatively limited compared to the long-term practical loading situation. Thus, long-term cyclic lateral loading should be considered in further research, and the combination of the practical steady wind, regular wave cases, and extreme storm loading cases will also be discussed. In-situ test results are the main data resource in early research to predict the p-y curves, which is very much site-dependent. In recent years, soil-pile interaction can be modelled using commercially available 3D finite element software such as PLAXIS 3D and ABAQUS 3D, but the accuracy of such models is highly sensitive to the calibration of soil stiffness and strength parameters. Instead, behaviour of monopile subjected to cyclic lateral loading can be conducted through centrifuge experiment which is an advanced physical modeling method filling the gap between field tests and analytical/numerical simulation.", "date_created": "2021-04-01 13:15:00 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-04-01 13:15:00 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 75084, "grant_number": null, "title": "Caroline's Plan", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Caroline van Calcar"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Caroline van Calcar"}, "description": "A recent comparison of 15 ice sheet models has shown that the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) will contribute -7.8 to 30 centimeters of sea level rise between 2015 and 2100. This projection comprises an uncertainty of tens of centimeters. To better constrain projections of the evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, more accurate simulations of the evolution of the AIS are needed. It is known that Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) has a stabilizing effect on the evolution of the AIS; directly by effecting the angle of the bedrock surface and indirectly by stabilizing the position of the grounding line. The timescale on which GIA feedback occurs is mainly dependent on the significantly varying viscosity of the Earth\u2019s mantle under West and East Antarctica. GIA is especially relevant when one simulates the evolution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the response time of the bedrock could be as fast as 100 years due to relatively low mantle viscosities of 10 to the power of 17 pa/s. However, most studies assume a much higher laterally homogenous response time and the stabilizing GIA feedback is neglected or accounted for on relatively long timescales. Here, we present a new method to include the radially and laterally varying GIA feedback in simulations of the AIS evolution by coupling an ice sheet model to a 3D GIA model on relatively short timescales of 1000 years. This study shows that, at the beginning of the Last Glacial Cycle, the grounding line position changes with up to 80 kilometers, and the total ice volume of the AIS increases by 0.5 percent over 5000 years if the lateral variations are included.

Applying a systems engineering approach to floating wind farms is highly desirable, due to the high complexity of the field, the multiple interactions between sub-systems and procedures, and the high impact that early-stage design choices can have on more advanced phases of the project. An overarching vision on the whole wind farm-related sub-systems and processes, from the beginning of the design process, would be critical to achieve optimal design, and thus to increase the overall system value.\r\n\r\nWithin this context, this research aims to gain understanding on different design decisions (scenarios) and embedded trade-offs that future floating wind farm designers will deal with, thus providing guidance to future designers and giving advice on which sub-systems and procedures have the highest potential to add value to the upcoming floating wind farm projects.\r\n\r\nThis research goal can be subdivided in three main steps:\r\n1. Define a set of design decisions (scenarios) relevant for the future floating wind farm designers, identify which subsystems and procedures will characterize future floating offshore wind farms, and which methods can be used to model them. The scenarios defined at this stage will specify the requirements for the framework.\r\n2. Implement floating offshore wind farms within a multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO) framework, and use the obtained framework to gain insight into the trade-offs embedded in the scenarios previously defined.\r\n3.

Since its creation in 2017, the MOOC Rethink the City has had more than 25.700 learners, involved students from 160 countries, and 37 lecturers from 20 different nationalities. The purpose of the course is to progressively build-up a critical perspective about local urban challenges in the Global South around the themes of spatial justice, housing provision and management, and urban resilience. After five runs, the course has consolidated a strong online community that have contributed with near 10.000 first-source visuals from all over the world, and developed multiple debates around pressing local and global urban challenges.  \r\n\r\nThis book draws inspiration from the online learning experience: its aim is to navigate through local narratives and international perspectives by developing reflections based on the students\u2019 work. The book builds a comprehensive overview of the local urban challenges we face in a global context, considering rapid urbanisation, the climate crisis, the increasing financialisation of cities, and socio-spatial inequalities. The main themes of the course: housing provision and management, urban resilience, and spatial justice are revisited with critical essays that combine students' and experts' perspectives. The goal is to trigger the debate on topics regarding the right to the city, adequate and affordable housing, resilience strategies, the relation between space and diversity, and planning in times of uncertainty.

Consequently, the interest to design sound is shifting from crafting the sound towards collaboratively understanding the role of sound and its position in complex environments, such as healthcare and autonomous driving, in which humans and technology must co-exist. Accordingly, the design process requires more inclusive, human-centered and technology-driven approaches to design sonic experiences. Yet the field of industrial design lacks systematic design methods and tools to empower design teams when they collaboratively express creativity through sound and discover sound-driven engineering solutions. Thus, with the PaDS (Participatory Designing with Sound) project, I aim at advancing the knowledge on sound-driven design thinking in which sonic communication speaking about sound and experiences, imagining and representing them) is especially required within multistakeholder design teams that consist of expert (sound) designers as well as non-experts (e.g., users, manufacturers, policy makers).\r\nThe main goal of PaDS is opening sound design practices to participatory approaches, in which stakeholders are involved in the design process as partners. The core of this project is the development of methods and representational tools to empower designers and other stakeholders to collaboratively conceptualise, express, and communicate sound-driven designs. To reach its goal, the PaDS project is based on a mixture of interdisciplinary approaches, including sonic interaction design, design cognition studies, and experimental psychology: Applied research and contextual inquiry of sound issues in complex, socio-technological environments provide relevant case studies of collaborative sound design-thinking, that is investigated through protocol analysis and perceptual experiments.", "date_created": "2020-11-16 13:30:56 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-04-13 09:03:22 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 71, "answered_questions": 22}}, {"id": 75175, "grant_number": null, "title": "Dhanashree's Plan", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-04-05 15:09:42 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-04-05 15:39:07 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 3}}, {"id": 75176, "grant_number": null, "title": "Peak Car Studying the perceptions of the young population in The Netherlands", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "The aim of the research is to study the peak car phenomenon and its perception among the young population in The Netherlands.

Ice shelves act as border control: by providing resistance to the ice, they prevent the land ice to enter the ocean and as such slow down sea level rise. When these ice shelves are weakened, for example due to surface/ocean melt or due to weakened shear zones as a result of damage, they become potentially unstable. This can result in ice shelf collapse, causing accelerated glacier flow and increasing sea level contributions.\r\n\r\nYet, assessing how much, how fast Antarctica\u2019s ice shelves are weakened remains a major uncertainty in projections of sea level rise as many of the processes that control ice shelf instability are not well understood or quantified. For example, the weakening of ice shelves due to damage in the sear zones is considered key for the collapse of Larsen-B ice shelf and the retreat of Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier, whereas at the same time it has been identified as one of the least understood processes in marine ice sheet dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe recent availability of frequent, high resolution, multi-source satellite imagery across all Antarctic ice shelves and the advent of big data and machine learning approaches offer now the opportunity to develop approaches to assess and understand the impact of these damage (changes) on ice shelf instability. The objective of this project is to use remote sensing and big data approaches i) to develop damage indicators across all Antarctic ice shelves and ii) to assess the potential impact of these damage areas on future ice shelf stability.

While these are vital for the application of bio-based plastics in more advanced products, they influence the end-of-life possibilities and sustainability.

The implications of river bifurcations for navigation, flood safety, and freshwater supply are crucial as these points govern how much water will flow to each of the branches downstream. In natural bifurcations, the division of water and sediment is typically asymmetric and the branches thus feature different sediment transport rates. For the Netherlands in particular, water and sediment discharge partitioning at the bifurcations in the upper Dutch Rhine are of critical consideration for river management as downstream locality may face danger if one of the branches starts receiving more water than expected or vice versa. Then the flood protection measures downstream, maintenance of navigation channels and freshwater supply for the whole nation- all would be affected. It is therefore, crucial to understand the morphological response of the bifurcation region and its subsequent impact on the partitioning to prepare for the coming future defined by rapidly changing climate and various anthropogenic interventions along the river reach.

Many efforts have been rendered in order to obtain accurate and computationally feasible solutions. One of the major problems arise in trying to solve the Helmholtz equation numerically is the convergence behavior of the underlying solver. For medium to large wave numbers, the linear system becomes indefinite due to the negative eigenvalues. In order to balance the accuracy for such large wave numbers and thus preconditioned iterative solvers are preferred. On the other hand, most of the practical problems involve large wavenumbers. Because an increase of the wavenumber leads to a better and better resolution, it will translate to solving very large linear systems. Therefore, the research problem that how to solve the systems efficiently and economically while at the same time maintaining a high accuracy by minimizing the pollution error arise in this field. Note that the number of grid points in each coordinate direction increases at least linearly with the wavenumber in order to have a bounded pollution error. This implies that the resulting problem sizes are huge, so only scalable parallel methods are able to solve these problems in an efficient way. To develop the high-performance iterative methods for the Helmholtz equation, most of the research will be on parallel implementations of the methods developed in our group, including the parallelization of the GMRES and Bi-CGSTAB methods preconditioned with the CSLP-preconditioner and a parallel version of the accelerated shifted Laplace preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation by two-level and then multilevel deflation. If time permits, we can generalize these methods to problems where unstructured grids are used. Furthermore, discretizations using compact stencils where the pollution error is minimized are also very important to be studied. Finally, part of the methods can also be implemented on FPGA's.

This risk can be reduced by modifying the risk factors using lifestyle modification programmes.

The aim of my research is to increase the robustness, interpretability, and efficiency of deep learning approaches in the safety-critical application of autonomous vehicles. A promising research direction to this end is to employ knowledge-driven models in a learnt deep neural network such that the benefits of hand-crafted and pattern-based methods are exploited.</p>", "date_created": "2021-07-07 12:24:39 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-11-02 12:52:10 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 80950, "grant_number": null, "title": "3mE-PhD-CanOzkan-Self_healing_coatings_for_corrosion_protection", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-07-07 12:16:38 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-07 13:35:49 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 7}}, {"id": 80949, "grant_number": null, "title": "3mE-PhD-Name_of _your_Project", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-07-07 12:16:36 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-07 13:36:12 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 3}}, {"id": 80957, "grant_number": null, "title": "3mE-CoR-Zhaochong Cai-Project", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": "Zhaochong Cai"}, "description": "Abstract for testing", "date_created": "2021-07-07 12:21:28 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-07 14:42:20 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 1}}, {"id": 80959, "grant_number": null, "title": "3ME-Disatance Learning", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-07-07 12:25:26 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-07 13:58:51 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 23}}, {"id": 80951, "grant_number": null, "title": "3ME-PhD-EW", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-07-07 12:16:38 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-07 13:44:40 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 15}}, {"id": 80952, "grant_number": null, "title": "3mE-PhD-MREALSTB", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Gerben van der Meer"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Gerben van der Meer"}, "description": "Development of a new type of MR-lubricated hydrodynamic bearing.", "date_created": "2021-07-07 12:16:38 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-10-18 14:07:58 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 80953, "grant_number": null, "title": "3mE-PhD-Lighten-ESR3", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Miguel A.

Membrane structures show good mechanical performance, they are energetically sustainable, require low maintenance, and provide abundant light. These innovative materials allow to create new designs of structures with unprecedented performance, despite the absence of proper construction codes for the use of these materials. This project aims to develop a framework to assist in the innovative design of ultra-thin membrane structures by augmenting classical topology optimization methods with machine learning. At the end of the project a new open source software will be delivered where the new method is expected to perform better than classical topology optimization methods in the design of membrane structures.</p>\r\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\">Traditional topology optimization is computationally demanding, which limits the search for optimum structures. In this work, we aim to complement this approach with a data-driven strategy to accelerate the search for the optimized structure. Very recent research has demonstrated that deep neural networks can reparametrize the design space and lead to faster convergence to optimum topologies in the context of inverse design. Yet, the architecture of the deep neural network is expected to affect dramatically the performance of the topology optimization algorithm. Therefore, we will investigate the use of automated machine learning techniques (autoML), more specifically Neural Architecture Search (NAS), to find appropriate architectures that are valid for a large class of topology optimization problems.

As a condensation of the public sphere, public buildings have turned into thresholds, into active public sphere agents that can motivate behavior and, as a result, produce public values. Public buildings designed for values should be created as unfinished processes instead of objects, leaving room for socio-spatial change and value dynamics. This research will use design- driven methodologies to show how spatial interventions in existing public buildings can incite public values. Connecting buildings and theories will highlight knowledge gaps leading to working hypothesis tested in experimental spatial interventions. Consequently, and as case study, the experimentation phase will explore the public role of makerspaces within libraries.

This research project adopts an actor-centred perspective and is specifically interested in the role collective and individual actors play in promoting sustainability and the different behaviours and strategies they employ to foster sustainable urban development. On the one hand, the project aims to clarify the transformative power of individuals (such as administrators, politicians and citizens) to initiate change in planning processes. On the other hand, the project is interested in the practices within organisations in the field of urban and regional planning (such as planning departments or city developers) to support sustainable development.\r\n\r\nAgency is particularly important when urban development does not follow linear procedures but unfolds in multi-dimensional and multi-scalar projects and processes. Against the background of social and political fragmentation, rapid technological change and complex global networks, a shift from formalised government-led development to informal governance arrangements can be observed in urban planning. Better knowledge about the role of actors is needed to understand how abstract and ubiquitous objectives like sustainability are operationalised through specific policies and concrete interventions in the built environment. By clarifying the role of collective and individual agency in the governance of sustainable urban development, the project aims to analyse and conceptualise the links between administrative contexts (planning systems), institutional norms (planning cultures) and spatial outcomes (planning practices). \r\nThe project investigates the application of the EU Urban Innovative Actions initiative in two countries (Finland and the Netherlands) and combines two research methods (Q methodology and expert interviews). The goal of the data collection is to learn about the work attitudes, daily routines and work relationships of people working in the field of urban and regional planning.

In practice the simplified methods predict such significant structural vibrations that feasible design of the structure becomes impossible. The alternative, uncoupled analysis, often creates inapplicable and unphysical results. In the SHIVER project TU Delft and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy B.V. develop a design tool which allows to overcome the challenges associated with current design methods and provides a means for optimized design of wind turbine support structures in ice prone regions. TU Delft builds on a decade of research into the problem of dynamic ice-structure interaction. Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy B.V. as an internationally operating turbine manufacturer brings project specific experience and expert knowledge required for the development of the design tool. The project will result in benchmark model-scale data for wind turbines in interaction with ice from ice basin experiments at Aalto University, Finland.

To make the most of the diversity in the project team and even strive for more diversity in the team composition, the project managers must learn to recognize the various types of diversity in order to be able to come up with different approaches fitted to the type of diversity that is prevalent in the project team and to mitigate the potential negative effects of diversity. \r\nThe research will adopt a qualitative mixed methods approach; a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, surveys, semi-structured interviews and Q-methodology.

In 2011, at the behest of the Cabinet of the Minister of Education, Science and Culture of the Dutch Caribbean, a very small and short-term research of the indoor climate of primary school classrooms was conducted on the Caribbean BES-islands (Bonaire (neighbouring Cura\u00e7ao), St. Eustatius and Saba). The reason for conducting this research was to make up a package of measures and requirements, which school buildings and their climate installations should meet. Up until this moment, Curacao has no regulations for the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) of classrooms. \r\nThe indoor environment of a school building depends on thermal conditions, concentrations of air pollutants, ventilation rate, lighting levels, acoustical performance and material use, but also the type of lighting, ventilation and heating/cooling systems applied, number of students per classroom and the length of a school day. The users can have different backgrounds (metabolic rate, situation at home, overall health, possible permanent or temporal impairments affecting sight and hearing, different native language, preference of temperature, IQ, concentration abilities, etc.). These differences make it difficult to design a perfect classroom in which all children feel comfortable, are healthy, productive, have a good concentration and eventually get good learning outcomes.\r\nUnlike most of the Caribbean islands, Cura\u00e7ao has a hot semi-arid climate (BSh in the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger Climate Classification System). For centuries, architects made use of the trade winds to cool the buildings they designed and stored rainwater to use in times of drought. The last decade there is a trend in installing air-conditioning in classrooms, which is costly and energy-consuming. \r\nThere is little to no research conducted on IEQ in the Caribbean, on Curacao or its neighbouring islands, so relevant research and theories need to be found elsewhere, preferably research conducted in areas with the same climate (hot semi-arid with trade winds).\r\nIn this research, the main aim is to develop strategies to optimize the indoor environmental quality of primary school classrooms in Curacao, in relation to the comfort and health of pupils. Through visual inspections of selected school buildings, monitoring climatic indoor and outdoor environmental conditions, questionnaires for students and interviews with school staff, workshops with students and workshops with stakeholders, strategies to improve and optimize IEQ of primary classrooms on Curacao will be stated.\r\n\r\n", "date_created": "2021-01-08 22:15:23 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-10-18 03:41:36 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 81075, "grant_number": null, "title": "Heather's Plan", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-07-09 12:02:19 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-09 12:02:19 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 81076, "grant_number": null, "title": "Heather's Plan", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "DCC Template", "id": 1638514350}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-07-09 12:14:02 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-09 12:14:03 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 13, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 81077, "grant_number": null, "title": "Performance of model based biodynamic feedthrough mitigation for touchscreens in a turbulent flight deck", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Giulia Leto"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Giulia Leto"}, "description": "This flight simulator experiment investigates the effects of turbulence on the input on touchscreens in continuous dragging tasks.

Therefore, the challenge in these routing problems is to design a robust network given the uncertain high-dimensional OD-matrices.", "date_created": "2021-04-15 09:42:29 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-15 06:31:11 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 75754, "grant_number": null, "title": "Ali Reza's Plan", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "DCC Template", "id": 1638514350}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-04-15 10:00:41 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-04-24 13:51:22 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 13, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 43901, "grant_number": null, "title": "Reframing mental wellbeing through big data", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Peter Kun"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Peter Kun"}, "description": "This project is a workshop study, where designers (workshop participants) use inquiry from social media data to better frame design problems around mental health.\r\nThere are two types of data collection happening\r\n1) Social media data\r\n2) Design workshop data.", "date_created": "2019-08-05 09:41:32 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-08-31 14:36:05 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 14}}, {"id": 35507, "grant_number": null, "title": "k,nnl", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "AHRC Data Management Plan", "id": 1148994747}, "funder": {"name": "Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)"}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Miroslav Boudny"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Miroslav Boudny"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2019-01-14 16:03:39 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-01-14 16:03:39 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 75764, "grant_number": null, "title": "PhD: Excitations in Disordered Superconductors for Radiation Detection", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1753695087}, "funder": {"name": "Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)"}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-04-15 11:56:23 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-04-29 13:45:49 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 40376, "grant_number": null, "title": "Optical nanoscopy investigation of microplastics bioaccumulation", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data management ZonMw-template 2019", "id": 1461074155}, "funder": {"name": "ZonMw (Nederlands)"}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Nicol\u00f2 Ceffa"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Nicol\u00f2 Ceffa"}, "description": "Plastic pollution is a global problem, particularly in aquatic environments.

To assess this health hazards, it is imperative to trace the pathway of nanoplastics through living organisms.\r\nWe propose a form of light microscopy sensitive enough to detect single fluorescent plastic nanoparticles deep inside living small marine fauna. We will focus on achieving the high spatial resolution and ultra-stable imaging conditions needed to track nanoplastics inside cells and between cells into different organs.

Rehabilitation of existing concrete structures is very urgent for stakeholders or the government. Among various strengthening methods, recent years witnesses a trend that existing damaged concrete structures strengthened by Ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) intrigues both researchers and technical staff since the addition of fiber will improve the tensile strength and enhance both the toughness and ductility of concrete structures.\r\nHowever, strengthening existing reinforced concrete structures with UHPFRC will lead to the formation of interfaces between old concrete and UHPFRC. The performance of interface always plays a great role in the mechanical performance of repaired structure because the interface is always considered as the weakest zone in composite structures. Thus, whether UHPFRC and old concrete compatible or not depends on the interface performance, which is still unclear.\r\nTherefore, the aim of my PhD project is to provide recommendation for strengthening design by investigating the interfacial behavior of reinforced concrete structures strengthened with UHPFRC combined with experimental method and modelling technique. As a result, the outcome of the research could be used to evaluate the safety of interface in the concrete structure strengthened with UHPFRC for the purpose of optimization of interface behavior for strengthened concrete structure.\r\n", "date_created": "2021-10-07 19:48:13 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-10-07 20:13:24 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 51589, "grant_number": null, "title": "Madeleine's Plan", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1753695087}, "funder": {"name": "Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)"}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Madeleine de Smaele"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Madeleine de Smaele"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2020-01-28 07:48:03 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-03-19 06:34:39 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 75791, "grant_number": null, "title": "LR PhD Thesis Project - Likhitha Ramesh Reddy", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Horizon 2020 DMP", "id": 852527588}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "Hydrodynamic analysis of floating offshore wind turbines", "date_created": "2021-04-15 14:29:37 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-05-06 08:45:10 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 71, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 75795, "grant_number": null, "title": "Modelling Data Engineering Pipelines for Computer Vision", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Agathe Balayn"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Agathe Balayn"}, "description": "We are studying how data engineering pipelines are structured in computer vision.

Fixed parameter algorithms show that such problems are tractable in cases when certain parameters of the network, such as reticulation number or network level, are believed to be small. Meanwhile, the parameter of treewidth is well-studied in parameterized complexity theory, and is the parameter of choice for many theoretical and practical results, as well as being smaller than the previously-mentioned parameters in real-world phylogenetic networks. We therefore aim to study network construction problems parameterized by treewidth. Such problems represent a unique challenge compared to many traditional treewidth applications, as the treewidth parameter applies to an as yet unknown graph, rather than a graph that is given as input.

Moreover, in the classroom students do a lot of activities and tasks such as reading and writing which can be impacted by indoor lighting and other interior elements. Lighting for educational spaces requires special attention because it has a relationship with students\u2019 preferences and needs. Thus, this research focuses on students' and classrooms\u2019 indoor lighting. In this study, a systematic literature review was conducted and some gaps were distinguished in the field of classrooms\u2019 indoor lighting and its impacts on students\u2019 visual needs and preferences. Indoor lighting quality should be suitable for students\u2019 needs which consist of their performance and health. One of the non-visual impacts of lighting on humans\u2019 health is related to sleep. It is proven that because of humans\u2019 circadian rhythm, the indoor lighting quality in the whole day has impacts on sleepiness during the day and also sleep quality at night. People have different chronotypes and sleep patterns that are related to their circadian rhythm. Research up to now did not focus on students\u2019 lighting preferences and needs in the classroom based on students\u2019 different chronotypes.\r\nTherefore, the purpose of this research is to examine the visual impacts of lighting conditions at the individual level and based on students\u2019 different chronotypes, visual needs, and preferences. Moreover, distinguishing the best lighting conditions for students with different chronotypes is of importance. Thus, based on the gathered information from the literature review, a questionnaire will be distributed to distinguish students\u2019 chronotypes, visual needs and preferences to indoor lighting conditions and then clustering them based on their responses. Some of the clustered students based on questionnaires will be invited and tested under various lighting conditions and by accounting for lighting interactions with other IEQ factors. New lighting technologies and building products as solutions for solving lighting problems and controlling indoor lighting for different clusters will be also tested. These lab experiments help to extract the effects of different lighting conditions on students with different visual needs and preferences. The outcomes of this research will provide some solutions to optimize indoor lighting in classrooms based on students' chronotypes and visual preferences and needs.\r\nKeywords: lighting, students, indoor environmental quality (IEQ), chronotype, preference, and need.\r\n", "date_created": "2021-06-18 08:43:20 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-13 11:08:43 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 27}}, {"id": 85718, "grant_number": null, "title": "Interviews: \"The role of flexibility from the chemical industry for sector coupling\"", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "Stakeholder interviews about the role of flexibility from the chemical industry for sector coupling.

Therefore, they need to make the transition towards a more circular urban metabolism. The integration of urban food production within the city, such as vertical farming systems, can potentially contribute to this transition by creating symbiotic relationships between the farm and the built environment. The key element to achieve such symbiosis is the use of synergies: the exchange of water, energy, materials, and nutrients between the two systems. Besides contributing to a more circular urban metabolism, the symbiotic integration of the vertical farm within the built environment can potentially improve the resource and energy performance of both the farm and its host building. Giving additional value to the farm next to the production of local food. However, more research is required into these synergies between the farm and the city, and into the environmental and energetic performance of such symbiosis. Therefore, the main research question of this thesis is formulated as follows: In what way can the integration of vertical farms within buildings and cities contribute to a circular urban metabolism, whilst increasing the resource and energy efficiency within the farm and its host building?\r\n\r\nPlease note, this PhD project is part of the NWO project SkyHigh.

While manufacturers and vendors keep deploying new products, infected devices can be counted in the millions and spreading at an alarming rate all over consumer and business networks. The objective of this project is twofold: (i) to explain the causes behind these infections and the inherent insecurity of the IoT paradigm by exploring innovative data analytics as applied to raw cyber security data; and (ii) to promote effective remediation mechanisms that mitigate the threat of the currently vulnerable and infected IoT devices.\r\n\r\nBy performing large-scale passive and active measurements, this project will allow the characterization and attribution of compromise IoT devices. Understanding the type of devices that are getting compromised and the reasons behind the attacker\u2019s intention is essential to design effective countermeasures. This project will build on the state of the art in information theoretic data mining (e.g., using the minimum description length and maximum entropy principles), statistical pattern mining, and interactive data exploration and analytics to create a casual model that allows explaining the attacker\u2019s tactics and techniques. The project will research formal correlation methods rooted in stochastic data assemblies between IoT-relevant measurements and IoT malware binaries as captured by an IoT-specific honeypot to aid in the attribution and thus the remediation objective.\r\n\r\nResearch outcomes of this project will benefit society in addressing important IoT security problems before manufacturers saturate the market with ostensibly useful and innovative gadgets that lack sufficient security features, thus being vulnerable to attacks and malware infestations, which can turn them into rogue agents. However, the insights gained will not be limited to the attacker behavior and attribution, but also to the remediation of the infected devices. Based on a casual model and output of the correlation analyses, this project will follow an innovative approach to understand the remediation impact of malware notifications by conducting a longitudinal quasi-experimental analysis. The quasi-experimental analyses will examine remediation rates of infected/vulnerable IoT devices in order to make better inferences about the impact of the characteristics of the notification and infected user\u2019s reaction. The research will provide new perspectives, information, insights, and approaches to vulnerability and malware notifications that differ from the previous reliance on models calibrated with cross-sectional analysis. This project will enable more robust use of longitudinal estimates based on documented remediation change. Project results and methods will enhance the capacity of Internet intermediaries (e.g., ISPs and hosting providers) to better handle abuse/vulnerability reporting which in turn will serve as a preemptive countermeasure.

The performance of interface always plays a great role in the mechanical performance of repaired structure because the interface is always considered as the weakest zone in composite structures. Thus, whether UHPFRC and old concrete compatible or not depends on the interface performance, which is still unclear.\r\nTherefore, the aim of my PhD project is to provide recommendation for strengthening design by investigating the interfacial behavior of reinforced concrete structures strengthened with UHPFRC combined with experimental method and modelling technique.

In comparison to current standard practice using implanted electrical stimulators, FUS provides high spatial resolution while eliminating the need for surgery. However, little is still known about mechanisms behind the way ultrasound modulates neuronal activity, and this may lead to obstacles in approval of ultrasound stimulation for therapeutic applications by regulatory agencies. The limited understanding of the stimulation mechanism is also reflected in the lack of consensus in the various ultrasound stimulation parameters used by different research groups. Previous studies on the mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation struggled with the limited spatial resolution of the stimulation compared to the size of the neurons. Although the focus of an ultrasound wave can be tailored to match the dimensions of a single neuron, monitoring the correlated response to stimulation is another issue especially in an in-vivo environment. To answer these challenges, organ-on-chip (OoC) technology is a promising approach to recapitulate human physiology in vitro. OoC offers an in vivo-like microenvironment for cell cultures in which responses can be thoroughly monitored in real time\u00ac. \r\nMy doctoral research project aims to develop an innovative organ-on-chip platform tailored to unveil the mechanism underlying ultrasonic neuromodulation. The novelty of the platform will be focused on the integration of high-fidelity stimulation and recording of neurons (tissue or organoid). Through this platform, the influence of different ultrasound parameters (frequency, intensity, burst duration, etc.) can be studied to find the optimum and safe stimulation.\r\nThe envisioned platform consists of three major components: a high-resolution ultrasound transducer, the reactor in which the biological sample is placed, and the electrode array that will record the electrical response of the sample \u2013 the latter being developed in a collateral PhD project at ECTM. There are challenges to be expected during the design of each component. The acoustic properties of an organ-on-chip platform have never been explored to the extent of the writer\u2019s knowledge.  For example, the confined nature of the reactor is prone to generate acoustic reflection which can alter the waveform generated by the transducer which leads to alteration in the position and intensity of the stimulation. \r\n", "date_created": "2020-09-16 11:40:00 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-15 05:05:13 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 10}}, {"id": 63683, "grant_number": null, "title": "Recognition of relevant activities in sports for injury prevention and performance improvement", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "NWO Data Management Plan (January 2020)", "id": 1506827492}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Michal Ciszewski"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Michal Ciszewski"}, "description": "Each year, there are 4.5 million injuries in the Netherlands.

These policies are driven by normative or political goals and differ from the traditional market failure approach that focuses on economic growth and fail to address the societal challenges. Innovation finds its true purpose in the hands of consumers and the relationship between consumers and missions is crucial for the longevity contribution to the success of the innovation. For the mission-oriented approach to tackle a challenge and for innovation to make an impact in society, demand for innovation is necessary. However, the existence of policies in the system does not ensure demand articulation, although it claims to tackle the challenge. The aspect of demand articulation has been introduced in the research, to emphasize on the need to investigate the barriers for consumption, as consumption is linked to demand. Therefore, it is important to understand consumption to explain demand articulation failures (i.e., the absence of demand) in transitions.\r\nThe research is designed to add relevance to the Mission Oriented Innovation System by diving into the case of the Dutch fashion industry and drawing insights from the case. The industry is an example of a socio-technical system that is in transition to Circular Economy (CE). There exist Mission-Oriented Innovation Policies to reach 100% circularity in the Dutch industry by 2050. Therefore, there is a need to understand what impedes consumption to better understand what impedes demand. This will be done by means of analyzing the barriers for consumption that individuals encounter, as no previous study in the context of transitions has been done. \r\nTo achieve sustainable development, sustainable consumption is an important aspect apart from efforts made on cleaner production. Sustainable consumption is constituted by buyer behavior, values and motivation towards eco-friendly products that result in less pollution during pollution. Although consumers are environmentally aware of their purchases, it is not in line with the actual market share of sustainable clothes. The increased awareness and consciousness of sustainability had a limited impact in forming purchasing decisions.\r\nFor a transition to a circular economy in the fashion industry, demand for sustainable and circular products is required. However, to create the societal demand, identifying factors affecting individual the consumption would be beneficial. However, when we look at the literature, we observe a lack of literature on consumer behavior and usage of CE business models, despite the presence of demand-side policies thereby leading to absence of demand or demand articulation failure. To solve demand articulation failures in the industry, it is crucial to identify what barriers form its root cause, as this forms important input for innovation policy. The root cause of demand articulation failures in transitions has been very little studied. It is not known what micro-level factors impede the micro-level consumption that constitutes the macro-level consumer demand. As these micro-consumption factors are not known, policies might not be effective to create demand.\r\nThe research focuses on the fashion industry, which is a demand-driven industry. Currently, the lack of circular fashion demand is a barrier towards the implementation of circular business models. Based on the research gap identified, the objective of the research is to better understand the demand articulation failure using the case-study of Dutch fashion industry that is undergoing CE transition. Despite the efforts to produce sustainable clothes, the fashion industries promoting circularity relatively make up a very small segment of the market. The study aims to identify and analyze factors influencing circular clothing consumption among Dutch consumers. Once the micro-factors obstructing the consumption behavior are identified, the factors could explain macro-level demand articulation failures. These factors would be an important input for the existing sustainable and/or circular policies in the clothing industry. This would help the policymakers to address and analyze these factors and further speed up the CE transition in the fashion industry.\r\n", "date_created": "2021-04-22 13:11:05 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-04-30 11:06:42 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 13, "answered_questions": 3}}, {"id": 85851, "grant_number": null, "title": "Master Thesis: questionnaire on usage of code coverage tools", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Andy Zaidman"}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "We will survey developers or project maintainers who have used Codecov (a software product) in the past to question them about their opinion on code coverage tools in open source tools such as Github, and their opinion on some of the services Codecov offers.

Although issues of accountability are well discussed within the AI ethics literature, we find little explicit conceptualizations with regards to current power dynamics underlying the development and use of a ML system. Yet workable conceptualizations are essential in order to formulate de-sign requirements to responsibly develop ML systems. In this dissertation, I aim to advance the development of responsible ML systems by formulating desirable design requirements through the conceptualization of current power dynamics. I firstly conceptualize the power dynamics ac-cording to the neo-republican framework and argue that an unaccountable exercise of power, or domination as understood in the neo-republican tradition, is morally problematic due to society's vulnerability to abuse (such as what happened with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, one of the main case studies for this dissertation). Secondly, I will formulate design requirements based on the results obtained in the first part of this dissertation. I will argue that responsible ML devel-opment requires safeguards with regards to arbitrary exercises of power (i.e. privacy violations, preference manipulation). This requires both effective accountability mechanisms with regards to ex post decision-making as well as democratic involvement during the design process in order to ensure ex ante control regarding exercises of power during the development of a system. I will develop this idea under the concept of design for non-domination, serving as a goal in itself (i.e., freedom as non-domination) and a method to obtain this goal (i.e., democratic procedures in-forming the design process). Thus understood, Design for non-domination provides a framework for ML stakeholders to comprehend and address the complex power dynamics underlying the development and use of opaque and self-learning AI systems.

Next, the flow can be changed to a two-phase tube flow, resembling the suspension flowing through the 3D printer.

For none-destructive inspection in the interior of cultural heritage, two complementary neutron-based experimental methods can be combined to simultaneously show internal structure and composition of the object: neutron tomography and gamma spectroscopy. To achieve this, both data sets need to be fused together in an innovative way.\r\nNeutron tomography can provide the geometric information including shape and size of the object. By subsequently performing gamma spectroscopy, information on the elemental composition of the interior of the object can be obtained. The aim of this project is to project this element-specific information back into the 3D neutron tomography computer model, in a quantitative manner. Effectively, one could describe the aim of the project as \u201crendering the grey-scale 3D model into a false-color model of the cultural heritage object interior\u201d, visualizing the elemental composition of the different parts inside the object.\r\nTo achieve these goals, I will perform ray-tracing simulations of elementary particles which I will benchmark against our experimental data. The ray-tracing will be based on the GEANT4  software package for high-energy physics, where we will develop an algorithm to iteratively adopt a 3D computer model of the cultural heritage object material properties so that the simulations can reproduce both the gamma spectra as well as the neutron tomography projections. The comparison between reproduced and actual data will serve as input for adjusting the model.

The participants of brainstorming session use them to bond with peers, make positive impressions on clients and increase income for the organisation (Sutton and Hargadon, 1996). Moreover, the common perception of participants of brainstorming session is that more idea-generation happens in a group then when alone (Paulus, Dzindolet, Po- letes, & Camacho, 1993). However, this is not always the case, as effectiveness of a creative process of a group are often characterised by production loss caused by cognitive interference (for- getting ideas, production of irrelevant ideas, inhibition of own ideas when other group member is talking) and social inhibition (fear about sharing own idea\u2019s with others caused by concerns about private reactions of others, comparison, free-riding). As a consequence, little progress is made and participants leave with a feeling of wasted time (Paulus, 2000). If it was possible to gain a deeper understanding of the group dynamics and socio-cognitive processes during brainstorming session, and investigate how those impact the creative process of the group, we could use technology in or- der to make meaningful intervention to facilitate the creative process.\r\nResearch Objective\r\nThe aim of this research is to develop a socially aware agent that will be able to moderate or facili- tate the creative process and their outcomes.

What distinguishes AGST from other biological wastewater treatment technologies is 1) the compact granular structure of the biomass that enables rapid settling and 2) a polymeric matrix giving structural stability to the granules that also acts as a protective layer against external stress. Moreover, the formation of granules creates oxygen and nutrient gradient across the biofilm which provides several microbial niches and thus, promotes microbial diversity. Higher microbial diversity provides added functionality which in turn increases the system\u2019s resilience and flexibility. These properties of AGST pose a promising potential for the treatment of more aggressive wastewaters originating from industrial activities.\r\nIndustrial wastewaters often contain high concentrations of organics and inorganics that could be non-biodegradable or reduce the efficiency of biological treatment processes. One of the factors that could hinder microbial activities is excessive salinity. Additionally, the carbon source is another determining factor that affects biological wastewater treatment processes such as biological phosphorus removal. These potential limitations to biological industrial wastewater treatment have led to the adoption of physicochemical treatment technologies by many industries. However, physicochemical processes require the constant addition of additives and often the production of secondary waste streams.\r\nThe aim of this research is to investigate the feasibility of industrial brine treatment with AGST and compare the results with physicochemical treatment methods such as High-Pressure Oxidation. Consequently, granulation under super saline conditions and the effect of alternative carbon sources on the microbial dynamics of AGST will be studied. To answer these questions, laboratory experiments will be performed under operational conditions defined by the involved industries. The result of this study will provide input for constructing a large demo plant for the 1) purification of industrial brine and 2) recovering biopolymers.

Participants will perform a driving simulator experiment where they will control a simulated car with a steering wheel that is constantly perturbed with intentional disturbance forces. No real driving task is simulated, but participants will use a simple dashboard display that shows the current rotation angle of the steering wheel together with a set of boundaries. The participants are instructed to resist the perturbations by keeping the steering wheel within these boundaries with as little effort possible. This will force the driver to adopt different admittance levels, which we will measure from the collected steering force, steering angle and grip force data. First, a set of time-invariant conditions is performed, used to construct an LPV model that predicts the time-varying changes in neuromuscular dynamics from grip force measurements (replicated from an earlier study). Second, a set of tests in which the steering wheel boundaries vary during each experiment run is performed, used in the validation of the LPV model. The goal of these experiments is to compare the identification results of the LPV model with the results of a recursive least squares identification technique that also identifies time-varying dynamics.

There has been a significant increase annually in ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) surgeries. Throwing at high velocity exposes great force on the medial structures of the elbow, especially the Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL). This ligament is important to stabilize the humeroulnar joint. Since the pitching athlete is moving the arm from maximal external to maximal internal rotation in the shoulder at high velocity, there is a substantial moment around the elbow joint. The movement of the lower arm exposes a great external varus torque on the medial compartment of the elbow, up to 105 Nm in professional pitchers. The hand and lower arm rotate around the axis near the humeroulnar joint and at the point in which the shoulder is maximally external rotated, the medial structures of the elbow have to counteract this movement with structural and functional stabilizers. Structural stabilizers includes capsular and ligamentous tissue, especially the UCL, and functional stabilizers includes muscles and tendons, especially the flexors of the upper and lower arm. To mimick the stress, standardized valgus stress is applied by using a Telos device. \r\nThis study has multiple purposes. The first purpose is is to determine what effect is present in humeroulnar joint gap after pitching training with different forces of standardized valgus stress on the elbow. The second purpose is to determine the effect of lower arm flexor muscle activity on the humeroulnar joint gap before and after repetitive pitching training.The last objective is to investigate the kinematics in relation to the shoulder and elbow muscle activity during pitching. 20 healthy baseball pitchers between 18-40 years old will be measured. The pitchers should not have complaints or injuries.. A Telos device (fig. 1) is used to standardize valgus stress on the elbow. Two electromyography sensors (fig. 1), which measure the muscles activity (Plux MuscleBANBE MB 03072016; Plux wireless biosignals, Portugal), are used to give visual feedback to the pitcher on the amount of muscle activity. The UCL ligament and humeral ulnar joint gap are measured with an ultrasound device (Samsung HM70A, Samsung Medison, Seoul, Korea). Three conditions will be measured with and without muscles activation. The first condition is with 0 kg valgus stress, the second with 15 kg valgus stress and the last one with 30 kg valgus stress. After the valgus stress measurements the pitcher will perform a usual baseball training session, where they will reach fatigue. See figure 2 for the research setup for the throwing part. Throwing at least 50 fastballs at maximal effort. The goal is to reach a fatigue state, which will be measured with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Fatigue is reached when participants will score above 90% on the VAS-scale. During pitching, muscle activity will be measured with the PLUX device and the kinematics of the pitcher will be measured with an motion capture system (Optitrack, https://optitrack.com/cameras/flex-13/). After pitching, the participant\u2019s UCL length and ulnarhumarl gap are measured in the same set-up as the first data collection: With the Telos device, electromyography sensors and ultrasound machine. The researcher who performs the ultrasound measurements is also a physiotherapist. Considering the COVID-19 restrictions on research and interhuman contact, the Dutch Physiotherapy Association (KNGF) COVID-19-guidelines are used to insure safety of both the researchers and participants. \r\n", "date_created": "2021-04-30 12:41:12 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-05-12 11:56:33 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 31}}, {"id": 76766, "grant_number": null, "title": "MSc Thesis TPM Dynamic Pricing", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Tom Hoobroeckx"}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "Research on the user behaviour in relation to dynamic pricing schemes in the context of the volatile supply (spatiotemporal) of free-floating e-moped sharing systems.\r\n", "date_created": "2021-04-30 12:48:29 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-08-19 21:51:12 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 30}}, {"id": 60905, "grant_number": "SFRH/BD/135923/2018", "title": "ABE/BK - Bridging heritage conservation and urban development policies: Exploring the implementation of the Historic Urban Landscape approach in Portugal.", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Ana Silva"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Ana Silva"}, "description": "The integration of heritage conservation and urban development in regulatory frameworks is one of the major challenges to urban planning today in the context of accelerated dynamics, which can irreversibly damage cultural protected areas.

Applying a systems engineering approach to floating wind farms is highly desirable, due to the high complexity of the field, the multiple interactions between sub-systems and procedures, and the high impact that early-stage design choices can have on more advanced phases of the project. An overarching vision on the whole wind farm-related sub-systems and processes, from the beginning of the design process, would be critical to achieve optimal design, and thus to increase the overall system value. \r\nBased on these premises, it becomes of primary importance for floating wind farm designers to have an insight into relevant trade-offs among the various sub-systems and procedures embedded into the design, construction, and operation of a floating wind farm, to understand system-level trends with respect to external variables, and to acquire valuable knowledge about how implementing innovative solutions can affect the whole wind farm.\r\nWithin this context, this research aims to gain understanding on different scenarios and embedded trade-offs future floating wind farm designers will deal with, thus providing guidance on which sub-systems and procedures have the highest potential to add value to the upcoming floating wind farm projects.\r\nTo this end, this work will deal first with the implementation of floating wind farms within a multidisciplinary design analysis and optimisation (MDAO) framework. MDAO allows for the simulation of the performances of complex systems involving several disciplines and subsystems. The tools representing the various disciplines are driven by a driver algorithm, thus fulfilling a functionality. The advantage of MDAO is that it allows designers to evaluate trade-offs and the impact of improvements and innovations at system-level. Therefore, the implementation of such a tool will enable the application of a comprehensive systems engineering approach to floating wind.", "date_created": "2021-05-01 16:54:38 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-06-22 15:38:06 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 81995, "grant_number": null, "title": "Hidde's Plan", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "DCC Template", "id": 1638514350}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Hidde Witteveen"}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "I am investigating how the application to the Human Research Ethics Committee could me made more streamlined so that the process takes less time for the committee and applicants and at the same time increases awareness in the academic community about the importance of ethical research", "date_created": "2021-07-26 08:47:18 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-31 16:19:50 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 13, "answered_questions": 13}}, {"id": 82006, "grant_number": null, "title": "Artistic Group Vibe Representations", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1506827492}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-07-26 09:56:15 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-26 09:57:46 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 82004, "grant_number": null, "title": "Artistic Group Vibe Representations", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1506827492}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-07-26 09:55:58 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-26 09:55:58 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 76787, "grant_number": null, "title": "TEST Sunlight", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "A recent development in wireless communication is the use of optical shutters and smartphone cameras to create optical links solely from ambient light.

In South Africa informal settlements are widespread twenty-six years after the end of Apartheid and the election of the first democratic government. The legacy of Apartheid in terms of spatial inequality and segregation remains an integral part of South African cities reflecting the challenges of reversing decades of Apartheid planning and policies that segregated cities by race and class (Dewar, 2008; Misselhorn, 2008; Turok, 2020). South Africa still has the highest rates of inequality in the world, with a Gini coefficient of 0.63 (World Bank, 2018), and segregation persists in reality in the composition of spatial planning and urban design (Misselhorn, 2008; Davies 1981; Turok, 2020). \r\nInformal Settlements in South Africa are response to this segregated planning, they offer an alternative to expensive accommodation and cater to low income individuals and families (Turok, 2018). They are also usually situated close to nodes of economic opportunity. These environments may not be formally planned, but they are home to more than 5 million people in South Africa (Statistics South Africa, 2017). Although informal settlements contain extraordinarily complex and effective social and economic networks, they typically comprise of limited services and a lack of formal security of tenure (Huchzermeyer, 2006, Elleh; 2011).\r\nThe large numbers of people, poor services and inadequate physical infrastructure of informal settlements in sub-Saharan Africa all mean that effective approaches to their improvement and upgrading are required (UN-Habitat, 2014; Werlin, 1999; Churchill, 1980). Different approaches to Informal Settlement Upgrading (ISU) are directed towards improving rights, security of tenure, physical infrastructure, social cohesion, amenities, economic stability as well as organizational and environmental difficulties (Ray, 2016). Similarly, Informal Settlement Upgrading and policy in South Africa has evolved to not just provide housing, but also providing support structures and amenities. ISU in South Africa aims to contribute to poverty alleviation alongside promoting social and economic integration of informal settlements by providing adequate housing, tenure, infrastructure and support structures for informal settlement residents (DHS, 2009). \r\nAlthough South Africa has developed numerous systems and evolutions of ISU since 2004, there is a gap in literature with regards to how spatial design influences residents\u2019 livelihoods (socio- economic patterns, levels of equality and integration) in upgraded projects. It is vital that these aspects are evaluated in order to ensure that the needs of the residents are met and to explore if they are indeed being provided with adequate spatial and well governed environments that allow for more equal and integrated cityscapes. \r\nThis research aims to evaluate the design and governance of Informal Settlement Upgrading in South Africa, through the multi-disciplinary lens of Architecture and Management in the Built Environment. The research will evaluate how spatial design of Informal Settlement Upgrades affects the livelihoods of its residents. It will compare spatial mappings from a designer\u2019s lens to that of the lived experience of residents through interviews.  In South Africa, Informal Settlement Upgrading is made up of two categories: \u201cGreenfields development\u201d which includes the displacement of residents from informal settlement areas, and \u201cIn situ Upgrading, where residents remain on original sites (Abbott, 2001). The research will evaluate the design and implementation effectiveness of \u201cGreenfields Development\u201d and \u201cin situ Upgrading\u201d. The research will consist of multiple case studies as well as literature review methods that will be evaluated through collecting information on the upgrading through public records, policy documents, existing case study literature, and from detailed spatial mapping and interviews.\r\nThis research will also measure the extent of community participation in Informal Settlement Upgrades, as this has a direct impact on in the spatial design, residents\u2019 involvement and ultimate success of the Informal Settlement Upgrading. John Turner (1976) and later Nabeel Hamdi (1995) in their respective books Housing by People and Housing without Houses have emphasized that the success of Informal Settlement development, be it spatial design or governance, is directly related to the amount of community participation in a development (Huchzermeyer, 2013 ; Chant and McIlwaine, 2016; Mukhija, 2003; Gulyani and Basset, 2007; Werlin, 1999; Sanoff, 2000; Van Ballegooijen& Rocco,2013) Greenfields development and In situ upgrading can be further classified into one of the following four thematic approaches: Progressive Improvement, Community Action Planning, Holistic Comprehensive Planning or the combination of Community and Local government Development (Abbott, 2002; Werlin, 1999) (Gulyani and Bassett, 2007). The research will utilize these approaches to assess the level of community participation of case studies and their impact on spatial design and residents\u2019 livelihoods.\r\nNot enough emphasis has been put on the experiences of residents of ISU, how they spatially experience these upgrades and how upgrades can be improved with regards to spatial design. This research therefore intends to explore these ideas, by formulating a case study evaluation of the spatial design of Informal settlement Upgrades through the perspective of designers and residents and the structures that govern them. The research will therefore explore the following questions:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWhat are the ways in which spatial design of Informal Settlement Upgrading in South Africa affects the livelihoods of its residents?\r\n\u2022\tWhat are the different terminologies and meanings associated with processes of is Informal Settlement Upgrading in South Africa and in an international context? What are the literature terminologies around this topic?\r\n\u2022\tTo what extent does spatial design and infrastructure influence the livelihoods of Upgraded Informal Settlement residents? \r\n\u2022\tWhat are the main social and spatial practices that characterize the livelihoods of Upgraded informal Settlement residents in Greenfields Developments vs in situ Upgrades? \r\n\u2022\tWhat are the main similarities and differences in the livelihoods of upgraded informal settlement residents of Greenfields Developments vs In Situ Upgrades?\r\n\u2022\tHow does community participation affect spatial design of Greenfields Developments vs in situ Upgrades?\r\n\r\n", "date_created": "2020-10-22 08:48:32 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-09-26 09:50:25 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 17}}, {"id": 77030, "grant_number": null, "title": "Practice", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "Data Management Plan for PhD", "date_created": "2021-05-06 08:39:21 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-05-06 08:41:08 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 77039, "grant_number": null, "title": "LR PhD Thesis Project -  Caroline van Calcar", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "This project aims to develop a fully coupled 3D GIA ice sheet model and to project the contribution of Antarctica to sea level change up to 2500 using non-linear 3D rheologies.", "date_created": "2021-05-06 08:44:27 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-05 13:03:32 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 77031, "grant_number": null, "title": "LR PhD Thesis Project - Federica Castino", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "The goal of my PhD project is to define, detect, and analyse \u201ccherry-picking\u201d solutions, i.e. eco-efficient aircraft trajectories leading to a large reduction of the aviation climate impact at relatively small cost variations.

Otherwise, attackers can just follow the breadcrumbs laid out by security advisories and exploit known weaknesses. This is indeed what happens in many large breaches. While progress has been made at the level of consumers, with automatic updates and default patching settings, this does not translate to enterprises. They face a painful dilemma: patch too soon and incur potential downtime and failures; patch too late and get compromised by attacks. As a result, organizations take a long time to patch even critical security vulnerabilities. The central objective of THESEUS is to empower organizations to patch much faster. It aims to achieve this by radically changing the risk governance of patching. Changing the risk of patching for enterprises means to develop interdisciplinary breakthroughs at three interdependent levels: -- Systems: reducing risk of patching via new techniques in automatic vulnerability and patch triaging, as well as automatic patch generation with live update for cases where critical patches pose unacceptable availability risks. -- Enterprises: better quantifying risk of patching by assessing and aggregating the results of the patch triaging, as a way to estimate exploit likelihood in a coherent picture that accounts for different attacker models and functional impact. -- Governance: more effectively managing risks of patching by introducing incentive mechanisms via notifications and information sharing, sector-wide benchmarks of patching speed, and potentially legal instruments. THESEUS sets out to (1) bring advances from the lab to real-world settings by working with a large consortium of partners from healthcare and transportation who contribute people, data, and pilots; and (2) replace the status quo, as well as counterproductive solutions like mandatory patching, with a richer set of governance interventions across different levels.</p>", "date_created": "2021-10-13 14:15:33 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-10-26 12:48:08 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 82214, "grant_number": null, "title": "Master Thesis", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-07-29 12:45:14 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-29 13:22:26 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 27}}, {"id": 82216, "grant_number": null, "title": "The Culture of Software Testing: An ethnographic study of testing practices in software engineering", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "DCC Template", "id": 1638514350}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Mark Swillus"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Mark Swillus"}, "description": "\u201cThere is a culture of software engineering comprising the human and social world in which it is participated, to inform develop and improve the discipline it essential that our profession try to understand this culture\u201d (Sharp et al. 2000 p. 8)\r\n\r\nSoftware testing is an integral part of software engineering practice.

This generates\r\nan increased vibration in the blades. This in turn impacts not only the performance but\r\nalso the fatigue life of the turbine. For this reason, a design and analysis tool with the capacity\r\nof modelling the fluid structure interaction under these conditions is of great importance. Such\r\ntool would enable a designer to better understand the physics of the problem and improve the\r\ndesign of the turbine. Currently, Eulerian solvers (e.g. OpenFOAM) are very efficient in accurately\r\nresolving the flow near solid boundaries. On the other hand, Eulerian solvers tend to be diffusive\r\nand to dampen high-intensity vortical structures after convecting it a short distance away from the\r\nboundary. The use of high order methods and fine grids, although alleviating this problem, gives\r\nrise to large systems of equations that are expensive to solve. Eulerian solvers also require mesh\r\ngeneration that can be cumbersome and require manual labour. Lagrangian solvers, for instance\r\nvortex particle methods, have shown to eliminate (in practice) the diffusion in the wake. As a\r\ndrawback, the modelling of solid boundaries is less accurate and much more complex and costly\r\nthan with Eulerian solvers (due to the isotropy of its computational elements). Lagrangian models\r\nare gridless, and allow for linear combination of solutions and thus superposition of elements.\r\nGiven the drawbacks and advantages of both the Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers the combination\r\nof both methods, giving rise to a Hybrid solver, is advantageous. The main objective behind this\r\nproject is to develop a 3D Hybrid solver implemented in OpenFOAM. In a region close to solid\r\nboundaries the flow is solved with OpenFOAM, where the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved\r\n(possibly with an arbitrary turbulence model or DNS, the limitations being the computational\r\npower and the physical properties of the flow), outside of that region the flow is solved with a\r\nvortex particle method. The project builds upon the work developed during the last seven years by\r\nPhD students and PostDocs. Currently, we have a 2D version of this hybrid code, able to model\r\n2D unsteady viscous problems.

This PhD project will be a part of the Exposome-NL project, that aims to assess the role of environmental exposures, the food environment and cardiometabolic health. \r\n\r\nIn the first two years, this PhD project will focus on the role of environmental exposures, sleep quality and quantity, stress, and lifestyle factors on T2D. Previous studies suggested that people with a short sleep duration and poor sleep quality are at increased risk of T2D. Studies also suggest that causes of a disturbance in the quality and quantity of sleep could be explained by environmental factors, such as light, noise and temperature. However, few studies investigated the proposed pathway of light, temperature and noise via sleep on T2D risk. Additionally, although stress is suggested as an important risk factor of T2D, associations between environmental factors, stress, diet and cardiometabolic health is unknown. For these analyses on stress and sleep, we will use cohort data from the Geoscience and Health Cohort Consortium (GECCO) to answer our research questions. We will also perform additional mediation analyses to study whether diet and physical activity are potential mediators on this association. \r\n\r\nOur environment is also known to influence healthy dietary patterns.

This might be due to a limited understanding of how the food environment affects dietary intake.

This leads to the inability to navigate a flight of stairs or increases the risk of tripping and potentially falling while they walk. The weakened muscles of these patients do not allow them to consistently accomplish the two basic movements required for leg progression: forward and upward movement of the leg during swing phase.\r\n\r\nCurrently, patients can artificially increase the foot clearance with passive orthotic devices that mainly tackle the ankle joint such as ankle-foot orthoses or Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). However, tendon-based assistive devices that effectively increase the foot clearance during stair climbing or walking have not been thoroughly investigated. We believe that such systems could benefit patients in providing additional support on the knee and hip enhancing their capabilities when navigating day-to-day obstacles.\r\n\r\nThis project represents the initial research on the potential capabilities of tendon-based systems in providing adequate foot clearance during stair climbing and walking.

Solving these problems would boost the efficiency and production quality of software development companies by allowing them to reuse OSS code with confidence, covering a large untapped potential.  To address this situation, the FASTEN project introduces fine-grained, method-level, tracking of dependencies on top of existing dependency management networks. Specifically, the project will introduce a service that tracks dependencies at the method call-graph level and performs sophisticated analyses of i) security vulnerability propagation, ii) licensing compliance, and iii) dependency risk profiles. To facilitate adoption, FASTEN will bring those analyses to the hands of developers by integrating the analysis service to popular package managers, for the Java, C, and Python programming languages.

Effective treatments for cancer metastasis, wound-healing and birth defects requires better understanding of the mechanisms of CCM. With computational methods I will elucidate the basic mechanisms that control CCM.\r\n\r\nCCM is highly complex and multi-scale: it involves interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM, a protein structure surrounding cells) from the molecular level of adhesion to the whole tissue level. Both physics (cell forces, ECM forces) and chemistry (intracellular signaling, ECM proteins) play a role. Based on biological observations alone it is difficult to decipher what are the driving factors and which are only auxiliary. I will develop multiscale models that describe the main aspects of CCM.\r\n\r\nMany different modes of CCM have been observed, such as clusters, or trains of cells, but models that describe transitions between these modes are lacking. My research aims to answer long-standing questions: 1) How do different types of cell-cell interactions and changes in the surrounding ECM change the mode of CCM? 2) Are particularly invasive cells, \u2018leader cells\u2019, that coordinate other \u2018follower cells\u2019, required for certain types of CCM modes? 3) How can a group of cells transition between modes in short time intervals?\r\n\r\nI will develop multi-scale computational models to propose unifying mechanisms for CCM and identify causes for variations in CCM. Because the interplay between coacting mechanisms are very important, I will combine detailed models of chemical and mechanical dynamics, short range (cell-cell adhesion) and long range (ECM stresses) communication between cells. This will lead to a more holistic understanding of CCM, relevant to cancer metastasis, embryonic development and wound-healing.

The research question for this experiment reads: \"To what degree can Motion Sickness in real-road driving be approached by Simulator Sickness in a motion-base driving simulator?\"\r\n\r\nA within-subject experiment will be used with 15-30 participants undergoing two scenarios representing the real-road drive and the near-identical driving simulator version. Subjects will be pre-screened based on their motion sickness susceptibility and proper functioning of vestibular system. During the experiment they will be seated in a real car and the I-39 Cruden simulator located in Amsterdam, and be passengers subjected to oscillations in surge and sway direction ('normal driving behavior) at a frequency of 0.2 Hz and accelerations of an approximate maximum of 5 m/s^2 (0.5g). Participants are asked to complete a sudoku puzzle as quick as they can. Both scenarios are experienced with a week in between and will take a maximum time of 30 minutes each (or until reaching a sickness level of 6/10). Participants are asked to rate their motion sickness on a 11-point MISC during immersion, also skin conductance and heart rate will be measured as these are correlated to motion sickness, and the time to completion of the sudoku.\r\n\r\n", "date_created": "2021-08-03 13:23:34 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-08-16 13:49:04 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 29}}, {"id": 86310, "grant_number": null, "title": "test24", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "DCC Template", "id": 1638514350}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-10-18 07:57:53 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-10-18 07:57:53 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 13, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 77591, "grant_number": null, "title": "BK-Energy Renovations for Lower Temperature Heating", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Prateek Wahi"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Prateek Wahi"}, "description": "The Dutch mission of carbon-free built environment by 2050 requires energy transition of the existing building stock by strategically phasing out natural gas of 1.5 million housing equivalent by 2030 to 7.7 million by 2050. The district heating approach with a low-temperature supply provides ample opportunities for this energy transition from natural gas to sustainable heating sources such as geothermal, residual heat from industry or data centres, solar heat, and sustainable gasses such as H2, Biogas and Biomethane. Heating with sustainable sources provides a lower temperature supply, increasing the DH network efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nThe lower supply temperature depends on space heating demands and domestic hot water (DHW) preparations. However, one of the challenges for providing a lower supply temperature in the existing housing stock is the higher heating demands, thus requiring extensive renovation measures to reduce space heating and hot water demands. The renovations of existing houses are currently based on the housing owners initiative, where the struggle is the selection of appropriate renovation strategies for using lower temperature supply. Furthermore, the existing renovation strategies are costly, time-consuming and lack integration with other building services. Such challenges are ultimately counterproductive towards the scalability of the energy transition. Therefore, the study aims to understand appropriate renovation strategies to enable the existing housing stock for lower temperature district heating.\r\n\r\nThe study's substance is to find renovation strategies by balancing heat demand at the building level and heat supply at the district level. Therefore, the primary objective of the research is to develop minimum renovation strategies applicable at the building level and develop a decision-making tool for selecting minimum renovation strategies for using lower temperature supply and its impact on multiple value aspects such as energy efficiency, carbon emissions, thermal comfort and cost for better decision making by the property owners.", "date_created": "2021-05-14 15:31:15 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-06 10:14:52 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 77604, "grant_number": null, "title": "Using data stream to support integrated design of infrastructure projects", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1506827492}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-05-15 13:37:19 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-05-15 13:37:19 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 77605, "grant_number": null, "title": "Using data streams to support the integrated design, construction and management of interconnecting infrastructures", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1506827492}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "My research, which is part of a bigger program: `NGI (Next Generation Infrastructure)\u2019, focuses on inter-organizational collaboration (i.e. collaboration between different actors from different organizations) with a particular interest in the early phases of projects.

In this era, multiple adjacent cities are merging and forming new spatial structures at a regional level. Compared with the traditional research object, the single city, a new and broader research object has gained much attention in recent years, the city-region. City-region, also called megalopolis, city cluster or supercity, is commonly defined as a city or group of cities within a wider territory that have a close, interdependent relationship. This larger metropolitan area helps to develop regional economy, and at the same time, attracts an increasing number of migrants.\r\n\r\nHowever, there has emerged more and more questions with the massive migration to city-region. One is the limited population capacity and high-rising housing price in the growth-pole cities of city-region. For example, Shanghai, as the growth pole city of Yangtze River Delta City-region, has a more than 3-time housing price than Wuxi, a smaller city in Yangtze River Delta City-region. As the most important growth pole and largest single center of Yangtze River Delta, Shanghai bears high pressure of housing.

Such indoor air pollution can cause severe damage to occupants\u2019 health, yet has been overlooked during non-pandemic periods for public spaces including school classrooms. Ventilation has long been recognized as a primary measure for indoor air quality (IAQ) control, yet recent research has aroused the concern that conventional systems cannot remove such contaminant efficiently due to its highly dynamic features. For school classrooms, on the one hand, the current design criteria of ventilation are in general based on perceived air quality, which may not be sufficient for airborne transmission control. On the other hand, the practical ventilation strategies in many schools have already failed to meet such criteria. Considering the long hours children spend in densely occupied school classrooms every day, it is thus of urgent need to provide them with proper ventilation against hazardous air contaminants. A number of personalized ventilation (PV) methods, for instance personalized air supply (PS) and personalized air exhaust (PE), were suggested to have promising potential for improving local IAQ. However, existing results cannot be adopted directly due to the differences in rooms settings, occupants, and indoor activities. Furthermore, other indoor environment quality (IEQ) factors can have interaction effects on IAQ conditions, yet rarely were these taken into consideration by previous studies when tackling IAQ problems.\r\nThis study is aimed to optimize ventilation strategies for solving aerosol-related IAQ problems in school classrooms, and improving overall IEQ for each student. First, a literature study will be conducted to indicate current gaps of achieving proper ventilation to minimize airborne transmission of infectious respiratory droplets between indoor occupants, especially for children in school classrooms. Second, a field study will be carried out among Dutch secondary schools to identify the IAQ related problems of existing ventilation strategies (both theoretical and practical) used in the classrooms. Third, optimization of ventilation strategies for school classrooms will be conducted base on the development of a personalized ventilation system via CFD modelling and prototype design, with a particular target of efficiently removing respiratory aerosols. Finally, the optimized ventilation strategies will be validated through lab experiments involving both physical performance measurements as well as overall subjective assessments of IEQ perception.

Besides, with increasing the density of CAVs in one lane, dedicated lanes could potentially enhance the traffic flow performance with increasing the possibility for CAV platooning. For this purpose, dedicated lanes to CAVs will be designed considering demarcations, signs, entry/exit configurations, and utilization policy.

Participants will be equipped with multiple inertial measurement unit sensors which will measure the angular orientation and angular velocities of movement. Moreover, multiple vibrotactile actuators would be attached on their affected arm by sticking them with a medical grade double sided tape. The vibrotactile actuators have a low weight vibrating element which oscillates to produce forces up to 3 Newtons. The amplitude of vibration is directly proportional to the current supplied to the actuator.\r\n\r\nWithin participant experiment would be performed in which each post-stroke patient would be asked to perform elbow flexion-extension 5 times with their elbow rested on a flat table for 3 tasks: 1) Initiation of elbow flexion-extension, 2) The patients move their arm in the entire range of motion they can achieve, 3) The patients perform pendular movement (repetitive movement between a short angle range) at the limits of their range of motion. \r\n\r\nEach of the 3 tasks would be tested using the following conditions: 1) No feedback/ sham feedback. 2) Physiotherapist providing feedback. 3) Haptic feedback using the inertial measurement unit and vibrotactile actuator system.

Water from this ocean escapes through geysers (plumes) from the icy surface into the exosphere, a newly forming atmosphere. Cassini fly-bys showed that the exosphere contains complex organic molecules. The origin of these species can be linked to two processes: 1) delivery of matter by cryo-geysers, as material from the subsurface ocean is expelled into space, and 2) surface material sputtered through impacting solar photons and particles originating from the Sun, Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere and cosmic rays. Both processes will be simulated through dedicated laboratory studies. These are performed with high-speed wind tunnel technology at TU Delft simulating cryo-geysers on a small scale, using the UHV ice setups available in the Laboratory for Astrophysics (Leiden Observatory) and in a new ice end station at the Free Electron Laser FELIX at Radboud University. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to determine physical and chemical parameters that allow to better characterize exosphere formation on icy moons, to explore the link between the composition of the ocean and the exosphere, as well as the resulting mass loss due to the exosphere being lost by the gravity from the nearby planet. Enceladus will be the focus of this study since large empirical data sets produced by Cassini already exist from which a comparison can be drawn. In addition, the results will be extended to different populations of exomoons, as icy moons like Enceladus are expected to exist also in other stellar systems, orbiting exoplanets.

A lack of proper scan patterns has been shown to be the cause for several crashes in the past. Current training methods do not make active use of eye tracking in evaluating scan patterns, although previous research has shown that visualising scanning patterns in augmented reality (AR) leads to promising results within the training process. Apart from AR, virtual reality (VR), an equally high-tech solution, is also increasingly likely to become a large part of training pilots in the future. The first VR flight training simulator has already been certified by EASA. VR headsets also prevalently contain eye tracking hardware, allowing for the integration of eye tracking without interfering in the training. \r\n\r\nThis thesis aims to review the current state of the art in eye tracking and use this to characterise the scan patterns of experts.

The research is divided into multiple phases. The first stage of the research involves performing CFD simulations using OpenFOAM for an OC5 DeepCWind semisubmersible floater. IEA Task 30 will serve as a benchmark for these simulations. The next part encompasses performing simulations for the OC5 semi-submersible floating wind system, which involves adding a rigid tower and a turbine to the semisubmersible floater model. Given the multi-scale nature of the problem, a fully-resolved LES model of the rotor is computationally unaffordable and that level of detail is not required for this case. Thus, an actuator line method will be considered to model the turbine rotor (Benard et al., 2018). Lastly, the focus of the research is to make the CFD solver computationally cost-effective by using mesh adaptation techniques to dynamically refine the grid at required regions and coarsen in other regions. With the blooming interests in the use of large wind turbines (10MW - 20MW) for offshore wind, the proposed framework could be used to study in detail certain load cases that are critical for the scaling-up of these turbines. In collaboration with other researchers within STEP4WIND, the data obtained from this project could be used to generate reduced-order models or data-driven models and formulate the correction terms for engineering models.", "date_created": "2021-05-06 08:54:36 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-08-10 13:38:22 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 82643, "grant_number": null, "title": "LR MSc Thesis - Heather Andrews", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-08-10 09:12:21 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-08-10 09:30:51 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 69931, "grant_number": null, "title": "Sjoerd's Plan", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "DCC Template", "id": 1638514350}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Sjoerd van Kesteren"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Sjoerd van Kesteren"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-01-21 10:25:06 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-01-21 10:25:13 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 13, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 77892, "grant_number": null, "title": "3me-PhD-Game Theoretic control for complex system of systems", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "ERC DMP", "id": 1547549517}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Emilio Benenati"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Emilio Benenati"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-05-20 09:14:05 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-05-20 09:15:34 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 8, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 77893, "grant_number": null, "title": "3me-PhD-Game Theoretic control for complex system of systems", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Emilio Benenati"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Emilio Benenati"}, "description": "This PhD project will focus on the development of techniques and algorithms for the solution of optimal control strategies in the case of multiple autonomous agents interacting in a dynamic environment.

A leading cause of this is the inhibited ability of drivers to anticipate the upcoming motion in automated vehicles as a result of reduced situational awareness, due to, e.g., novel seating arrangements or engaging in non-driving related activities. To curb the risk of experiencing more motion sickness in automated vehicles, it is therefore important that motion anticipation is facilitated in other ways.

Indeed, gardens positively impact the liveability and sustainability of cities and metropolitan regions: they are greatly beneficial to human and non-human health and well-being (2), they mitigate climate change e.g. by easing urban heat island effects (5) and urban water stress, they alleviate the ecological impact of urbanization (2, 3, 4), and act as transitions between private and public.

Firstly, we aim to gain insights into the artistic process of creating/making the eight dance videos.

The presence of network effects in both of them has opened a whole new research stream that studies how networks of users and stakeholders should be constituted to optimally face competition with other technologies. In this regard, social network theory turns up as a new  approach to study these networks and the coordination mechanisms present in them. At the same time, it is of contemporary debate that companies owning or producing these technologies have cumulated a market power that overcomes their regulating measures. Technological oligopolies and monopolies find their origin in network effects and investigating how these are generated is of current interest. Additionally, merging social network theory with literature on standards and platforms contributes not only to the technology and innovation management literature, but also to adjacent fields of sociology, law, policy, ethics and sustainability.

Remarkably, this ~40 nm wide pore is capable of efficient and fast transport while remaining highly selective. Its dense central channel is composed of a highly dynamic spaghetti-like mesh of intrinsically disordered proteins that allows small molecules to pass freely, whereas large macromolecules (>40 kDa) rely on specific transporter proteins that ferry their cargo across the pore. Even though various models have been proposed, the fundamental biophysical mechanism of nuclear transport and of the selectivity of the NPC has not been resolved yet. One of the main reasons that have hindered our progress in understanding nuclear transport is the lack of experimental techniques that can probe the structure and dynamics of the disordered proteins and transport receptors inside the NPC channel and during transport with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. In the proposed action, I aim to establish a modifiable biomimetic platform for single-molecule investigations of nuclear transport. This interdisciplinary and innovative approach combines solid-state nanopores, coated with disordered proteins to mimic the nuclear pore, with optical detection in zero-mode waveguides and DNA origami nanotechnology. The proposed experiments will allow to monitor the translocation of single fluorescently labelled molecules through biomimetic NPCs with excellent sensitivity and specificity. I will use this platform to elucidate the biophysical principles that underlie the structure and selectivity of the NPC channel and the mechanism of active nuclear transport. The direct insights on the single-molecule level obtained by the results of this project will be crucial for our understanding of the molecular principles that govern nuclear transport.", "date_created": "2021-08-22 08:09:17 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-08-22 08:12:08 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 71, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 38843, "grant_number": "KvW-00113", "title": "Power Parking", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Yasemin Turkyilmaz-van der Velden"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Yasemin Turkyilmaz-van der Velden"}, "description": "The project aims to construct solar power carports with smart charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in a way that the storage capacity of the vehicles is used to increase the amount of solar energy used onsite and reduce the impacts of unscheduled electric vehicle charging on the electric distribution system.

One option for keeping the sun (heat and glare) out of buildings is to apply sun shading measures. The major disadvantages of these are the limited control on the amount of solar radiation entering the room, and the loss of contact of the user with the outside world that can lead to a feeling of \u201ccontainment\u201d. A possible solution is to use electrochromic (EC) glass, where the optical properties of the glass (tinting) change upon the application of an electric potential in order to realise HVAC energy savings and improve user comfort. This would accommodate permanent contact with the outside world, as well as precise control of solar heat gain and glare in a space. There are two drawbacks which hamper large scale market introduction of EC glass: first the price, resulting from the manufacturing process (sputtering), which is currently between 500-1000 \u20ac/m2, and secondly the blue colour when tinted, which is perceived unfavourably by many users. Brite has developed its own EC glass production process by means of low cost ink-jet printing, which allows a major price reduction to 100 \u20ac/m2. Furthermore, a grey colour in addition to the blue has been developed for improved user experience.\r\n\r\nProject Aim\r\nThe main aims are a) to achieve the upscaling of the inkjet printing production process for the manufacturing of EC glass from 50 x 50 cm to 1.2 x 1 m on an industrial pilot production line with a capacity of 100,000 m2/year, b) to demonstrate this EC glass in a typical building environment, and to collect valuable information about the possible energy savings and the user experience it can offer in everyday practice, and c) to explore the viability of the business case for the end users.\r\nBrite\u2019s product can solve the issue of the high costs of currently available EC glass and increase user acceptance because of the more subtle colour. No other companies are working on inkjet printing of EC glass, which is also patented by the company. Brite has demonstrated the functionality on 50x50 cm samples and this project will be an important step towards implementing the process on an industrial pilot production line and towards market introduction of the product, which is intended to start immediately after completion of the project.\r\nThe project fits well into Program Line 2, sustainable installations for heating and cooling, and attractive interior climate. The EC glass allows control of the interior climate with much decreased energy consumption for HVAC systems, its operation is imperceptible, it requires no additional space, it offers full control on the degree of shading and glare elimination, it improves daylighting, and offers unimpeded contact to the outside world.\r\n\r\nProject Activities\r\nTo achieve the project goals, Brite will tune its production process and materials properties in order to ensure industrial-scale production at the required levels of product quality (e.g. uniform colouration when in operation). Si-X will design the insulating glass unit in which the EC glass plates will be installed and will integrate it at the demonstration site. TU Delft will be responsible for the performance measurements. These include measurements of irradiance, glare, energy use for heating/cooling, room temperature, and outdoor weather conditions. The user experience will be determined (TU Delft) by logging user control actions and via questionnaires regarding people\u2019s perception of the room temperature and amount of light, colouring of the room, glare, and the use of the EC windows. The project partners will set up the business case, not only based on the measured energy savings, but also by looking into alternative business models such as leasing structures.", "date_created": "2021-08-23 14:41:32 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-10-04 14:52:17 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 27}}, {"id": 83136, "grant_number": null, "title": "Case study Listening Game", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1506827492}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "annebeth erdbrink"}, "data_contact": {"info": "annebeth erdbrink"}, "description": "The study aims to explore the effect of the game Luistermutant (single player mobile game developed by the researchers and TU Delft Gamelab) about listening to others. \r\nRQ: To what extent does the game influences the responsibility, attitude and behaviour of players concerning listening to others? \r\n", "date_created": "2021-08-23 14:21:40 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-09-13 13:42:04 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 71960, "grant_number": null, "title": "A user-oriented approach to a hip-brace design for Trendelenburg gait.", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-02-21 09:14:57 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-04-16 13:02:04 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 83152, "grant_number": null, "title": "Yasemin's Plan", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-08-23 16:50:16 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-08-23 16:50:35 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 2}}, {"id": 53505, "grant_number": null, "title": "Paul's Plan", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Paul Ranshuysen"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Paul Ranshuysen"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2020-02-26 10:15:36 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-02-26 10:15:36 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 69374, "grant_number": null, "title": "Validation of Personal Values and Musical Preferences Map", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Sandy Manolios"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Sandy Manolios"}, "description": "In a previous study, we conducted interviews using the laddering technique to elicit a map from around 30 participants.

For this purpose, we developed a steer-assist bicycle (a video of a previous prototype can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBOQp2uY_lk). The aim of the experiment is to validate the design. The experiment answers the research question if cyclists can withstand higher perturbation forces while riding the steer-assist bicycle.\r\n\r\nIn the experiment we will perturb the handlebars of a conventional and of a steer-assist bicycle while the participant is riding the bicycle on a treadmill in a safety harness. The magnitude of the perturbation will be increased until the cyclist falls. The safety harness is the RYSEN system from Motek. The perturbation system uses ropes and is almost similar to the Bump\u2019em system [2]. The ropes are attached to the handlebars. Safety harnesses have been used in gait fall experiments before and rope pulls have been applied in cycling perturbation experiments before [3-11].

The way we produce and operate cities matter, for global urban population is expected to almost double by the end of this century. Coupling the latter with ever- increasing levels of production and consumption pushes humanity far beyond the safe operating space identified by the so-called planetary boundaries.\r\nAt different institutional levels, ranging from local to global, different public and private initiatives have started to build up transitioning visions towards circular built environments (CBE). Coherence in policy process and implementation is recognized as a key factor to ensure the effectiveness of sustainable transitions. However, coherence is often restricted to the assessments of policy processes (as in the fulfillment of prevailing policy cycles), and tends to overlook higher levels of coherence, for instance, that of an adequate policy set-up in relation to other sectorial policies and to the current, critical state of the climate and ecological crises and the urgency for a change.\r\nThis research aims to develop a policy coherence perspective to the design and implementation of policies aiming for drastic changes in the production and operation of the BE by introducing CE strategies. To develop this approach, a mixed-method approach based on comparative case studies of CBE-policies has been selected. The main scientific contributions of this research are: Firstly, this research will explore widely acclaimed systemic views of policy making towards CBE implementation. Secondly, it will extend the field of transition management to the CE in the BE, a growing sustainability transition that only recently has started to be discovered in transition research. Thirdly, it will provide new perspectives of policy coherence by focusing on (1) the consistency within ongoing policy processes, (2) the inclusion of policy instruments suggested in CBE research in such policy processes, and (3) the resulting learnings on the implementation of CE policy-making strategies from the comparison between different emerging socio-technical regimes. Concretely, this research seeks to offer a policy coherence perspective for CBE transition policies by enhancing policy coherence in terms of policy process, its circular ambitions and its relation towards the planetary boundaries.\r\nThe expected results of this research will serve to improve recently created CBE transition policies, and those yet to come around the world. Likewise, it will provide a more radical perspective to mainstream \u2018circular\u2019 efforts, seeking to unleash the highest ambitions of the CE, and to keep the human enterprise with regard to the BE within the planetary boundaries. However, the frameworks and methods used to accomplish the research\u2019s goals are not exempt from its own limitations. Therefore, its findings provide under no circumstances exhaustive methods or \u2018policy recipes\u2019.

An important aspect of the human\u2019s supervisory role is to take over control from the automated vehicle when needed. However, interaction with automated vehicles could result in the human driver to disengage from the driving task - willingly or unwillingly \u2013 which affects the driver\u2019s ability to adequately take control over from the automated vehicle when needed. This raises the question of how the ability of the human driver to take control impacts their perceived responsibility in case a road accident occurs.

The strategy relies on the notion of social contagion, exploiting the interdependency of decision making among neighbours. The strategy follows three phases: identify, activate and accelerate. \r\nFirst, specific households (nodes) in a social network are identified whose actions may influence others to act too, i.e., the seed nodes. In this phase, complexity modelling is aided by user research and context-mapping techniques of design. Second, these specific households are activated to adopt alternative sustainable energy sources; making use of methods of participatory action research and design for behaviour change to develop interventions. Finally, through social contagion a chain reaction of subsequent decisions by influenceable neighbours will accelerate a network-wide transition. The complexity model is recalibrated with data gathered from the unfolding contagion, which in turn suggests new targets that can sway their neighbours subsequently. Design methods are used to shape tools for these three steps of subsequent transfers throughout the network. Ultimately, a three-staged intervention strategy is produced for municipalities that leverages social contagion to transition away from natural gas. \r\nThis interdisciplinary collaboration promises to integrate and advance research strands from complexity, sociology, and design. Complexity, modelling, network analysis and developing design interventions all aim to facilitate emergent behaviour within the community.

But, it is unclear how this inclusion or exclusion impacts the outcome and success of a participation practice. Given that online participation practices have an influence on the inclusion and exclusion of certain citizens, the main question in this research is: how do this inclusion and exclusion have an impact on the success of the participation practice \u201cDe Nieuwe Kern\u201d in Ouder-Amstel? To answer this question, a case study of the online participation practice for \u201cDe Nieuwe Kern\u201d is conducted. The case study is investigated by using both quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the excluded citizens from this practice and why these citizens are excluded. Subsequently, a simulated offline practice is carried out among the excluded citizens to be able to compare the results of the original online practice, in which certain groups were excluded, with the results of the simulated practice in which these people were included. The result of this research is strongly dependent on the willingness of the excluded citizens to participate in this research. Therefore effort have been made to lower the barriers to participate as much as possible.

Such deep networks are incredibly powerful machines that do not use physical models to design relevant image features, but instead use huge datasets to learn the relevant features. \r\n\r\nExcellent recent research investigates how to make deep networks more data-efficient, yet, to date, however, little work has addressed how to overcome the data dependency by adding prior knowledge to deep nets. As a consequence, all knowledge has to be (re-)learned implicitly from data requiring huge data and compute resources. My project Tabula Inscripta aims to remedy this gap by investigating *how to flexibly pre-wire deep networks with generic visual innate knowledge structures*, which allows to incorporate hard won existing generic knowledge from physics such as light reflection or geometry. \r\n\r\nTo tackle this research question, I decompose the \"visual\" prior-knowledge into appearance and appearance-free models while the \"flexibility\" is decomposed into plasticity, which will allow a deep net to pass-by the knowledge priors if the model does not help, and in re-use, which aims for a plug-and-play deep network architecture where knowledge modules can easily be shared in the community.

Fitness trackers such as the FitBit, are non-invasive tools that can accurately monitor the heart rate, physical movements and acceleration of study participants in an outstudy participant setting.

The main objective of this study is to collect empirical data to quantify the performance of the ProPilot and the interactions of other vehicles. The ProPilot electric vehicles are commercial vehicles . We plan to collect the empirical data using three video cameras installed on each of the two vehicles (facing front, and facing the two sides of the vehicles), in addition we will add a video camera facing the dashboard in the car and a regular GPS. Furthermore, an additional traditional vehicle from TNO will be equipped with a Streetlive (records the vehicle motion characteristics - no video images) . Nissan has developed an algorithm to blur license plates and faces, and the algorithm will be employed for processing the data. Only the images with blurred licence plates and faces will be saved. We will drive the vehicle with the ProPILOT Assist system activated only on roads and situations that fall within the type of roads as specified by the vehicle manufacturer user manual (OWNER'S MANUAL SUPPLEMENT). The ProPilot Assist system is composed of an Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC) and Steering Assist. One member of the research team who has a Dutch driving license and driving experience in the Netherlands will be driving the vehicle. A co-driver will be seated in the back seat in an opposite direction to the driver. Both will wear face masks during the tests. The driver and the co-driver will be asked to sign the loan agreement of Nissan and an informed consent. Identifiable information of the drivers is not needed and will not be registered.

In absence of a cure for stroke, clinical evidence suggests that patients should engage in personalized, task-specific, high-intensity training to maximize their recovery. Additionally, neuroscience suggests that both realistic visual and somatic sensory information play a fundamental role in generating skillful movements. Potentially, rehabilitation robots could provide this, but current robots only provide high-intensity training for non-functional movements, which is neither personalized nor task-specific. First, robots do not adapt the therapy to patients\u2019 particular and dynamic deficits, hampering its effectiveness and putting a tremendous burden on therapists who must handle intricate high-dimensional data to infer therapy recommendations. Second, current robot-aided interventions rely on abstract visual feedback that is cognitively demanding while somatic (tactile and proprioceptive) feedback is underutilized. \r\nI propose to radically improve robot rehabilitation, based on a deep understanding of the processes by which somatosensory feedback promotes skill acquisition. First, I will extend the understanding of VR-based techniques, such as the impact of embodiment and the influence of virtual environment\u2019s complexity on patients\u2019 cognitive workload, to design VR that maximizes skill acquisition. Second, I will study the underlying mechanisms by which somatic feedback influences the learning of multi-joint arm movements, and develop new methods for delivering tactile feedback to promote learning to manipulate objects. Third, I will study how to best personalize therapies, combining machine learning techniques with therapist expertise in a Hybrid AI framework.\r\nI will exploit these fundamental findings by incorporating immersive VR, augmented somatic feedback, and therapy personalization into a hyperrealistic multisensory robotic neurorehabilitation system (HyPerRealisticRehab), leading to unprecedented levels of improvement in sensorimotor function for a diverse set of patients.

A reliable estimation of the traffic demand can lead to optimization in network use, which in return contains benefits for both users in their daily trips and administers to invest appropriately in infrastructures according to future network demands.\r\nHaving a reliable estimation and prediction of demand is the overall goal of my part in the project, but the area in which little research has conducted so far is concerned with the variables and factors in the model or data or method that may cause bias in the outcome results. Therefore, identification of bias components and measure the feasibility of traffic demand estimation/prediction based on a specific detail in the accessible data is my research objective.\r\nIn terms of data, it is critical that measurements from new data sources are statistically representative and corrected for biases inherent in new data. This process requires the integration of new pervasive data with reliable (though less extensive) traditional data sources such as the census or travel surveys (Toole et al., 2015).\r\nVarious types of data can cause different errors and bias components. One of the most promising data sources in the traffic demand estimation field is GSM traces in the form of CDR (call detailed records) data (Becker et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2016). Analyzing the sequence of CDR data of a device offers the opportunity to extract its movement and determine the trips being made. Furthermore, it offers the opportunity to recognize the daily traffic flow better and to update transport models more frequently, providing more precise decision information which would make it possible to address problems faster, also addressing problems of which little was known (e.g., non-regular mobility behavior), or problems that are difficult to model. Because collecting these data is less time consuming and costly, it also offers the chance to use this type of information for other services provided by private sectors (e.g., for marketing purposes) (Wismans, Friso, Rijsdijk, de Graaf, & Keij, 2018).\r\nGreat admiration of CDRs in the research is mainly because of 1) their colossal size due to months of communication and mobility behavior traces of millions of mobile phone users, 2) their relative ease of extraction and use, for they have a standard format, are preprocessed for billing purposes, and are archived in recognized databases.\r\nI aim to identify and reduce the bias in demand estimation/prediction outputs so that it describes the current and future demand patterns in an accurate way. This research provides a new insight into assumptions with their consequences resulted from the data (particularly GSM traces) and mechanisms that researchers use to estimate and predict the traffic demand and in this area, little research has been conducted so far.

Humans are infected by four main parasitic STH species. These species are: Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworms), Trichuris trichiura (whipworms), Necator americanus & Ancylostoma duodenale (hookworms), and Strongyloides stercoralis (threadworms). STH parasites in humans are identified by microscopy-based examination of faecal samples. One common procedure for the diagnosis of STH, with the exception of S. stercoralis, is the preparation and examination of Kato-Katz slides. This procedure can be used not only to detect the helminth eggs but also to quantify the intensity of infection by counting the number of eggs observed (Katz et al., 1972; WHO Expert Committee on the Control of Schistosomiasis (2001\u202f: Geneva & Organization, 2002). However, the outcome of microscopy-based diagnosis is operator-dependent and may lead to result discrepancies or variabilities (Vallejo et al., 2015). Research shows that discrepancies or variability due to operator-related factors still occur even when all microscopy procedures are followed, especially during manual microscopic examination of samples (Gadeholt, 1964; Winkel et al., 1974). Such variability or discrepancies can however be removed by integrating traditional microscopy with smart optical devices, combined with pattern recognition software (Yang et al., 2019).\r\nSmart automated optical devices combined with pattern recognition software present various opportunities to support traditional microscopy. Firstly, it provides the ability to automate and capture digital images of prepared samples that are stored for analysis at any moment in time. These digital images of prepared samples can be used to support remote diagnosis or seek a second opinion on previously diagnosed cases (Dendere et al., 2015; Tuijn et al., 2011; Vasiman et al., 2019). Secondly, it allows for automated assessment and quantification of STH parasitological infection of stool samples. D\u2019Ambrosio et al., 2015 demonstrated the use of a smartphone-based microscopy platform that automatically detects and quantifies filarial parasites in prepared blood samples. A similar implementation of automated assessment and quantification of STH parasitological infection in stools samples will save time to analyse prepared samples, increase diagnostic performance and remove operator-related discrepancies that occur during sample analysis (Dacombe et al., 2007; Martin & Beaver, 1968; Stuyver & Levecke, 2021). Thirdly, smart automated optical devices combined with pattern recognition software can be used for quality control and regular monitoring of microscopic results (Banik et al., 2021). For example, integrating traditional microscopy with smartphone-based optical devices have been used to detect bacterial and viral contamination in food with the goal to provide quality control (Rateni et al., 2017). The application of similar technology could provide quality control and regular monitoring of STHs microscopic results (Stuyver & Levecke, 2021). \r\nImpressive capabilities of integrating smartphone-based devices with pattern recognition software and traditional microscopy continue to be demonstrated in various clinical applications. However, assessing the stakeholder perspective and the needs for integrating and applying these technologies for detecting STH parasites in stool samples during clinical trials needs to be identified. Besides, stakeholders should be involved from the earliest phases in the development and integration of new diagnostic devices for STH and Neglected Tropical Diseases(NTDs) (Lundin & Dumont, 2017). Therefore the research study proposed here focuses on: What are the stakeholder perspectives on implementing a smartphone-based optical device combined with pattern recognizing software for the detection of STH's parasites in stool samples during clinical trials?\r\n", "date_created": "2021-06-09 15:16:34 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-09-13 15:09:59 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 17}}, {"id": 79168, "grant_number": null, "title": "Master's thesis (Vulnerability Risk Modeling in Open Source Software Systems)", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "DCC Template", "id": 1638514350}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Rens Heddes"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Rens Heddes"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-06-09 16:03:15 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-31 16:19:50 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 13, "answered_questions": 13}}, {"id": 83317, "grant_number": null, "title": "Perceptions of Safe-by-Design for Biotechnology", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Dr. Amalia Kallergi "}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "Safe-by-design is a new concept that urges the developers of new technologies to integrate safety early on in the design process.

With benefits such as automated workflows and personalized services on the horizon, exchanging high-quality data is critical. In the past, public agencies developed their own information exchange chains and accompanying infrastructures. These infrastructures have become outdated, inflexible, and costly to maintain. Therefore, both in literature and in practice, the data ecosystem approach is gaining attention. Data ecosystems refer to data exchange models in which multiple private and public actors provide and employ a dynamic portfolio of data exchange services and resources for various processes.  The ecosystem approach shows that government agencies can employ the software market's innovation capacity to ensure high quality data exchange.\r\nHowever, the problem is that we lack insights on which design variables and configurations lead to successful data ecosystems. We also do not know how to define successful data ecosystems. This lack of knowledge can lead to poorly configured data ecosystems, with disadvantages on multiple levels (e.g., high dependency on market parties, lock-in, low data quality, and low system quality).  The proposed PhD study aims to close this knowledge gap by investigating configurations of government-driven data ecosystems.\r\nThis research uses the configurational approach to create knowledge on configurations leading to (un)successful government-driven data ecosystems and create a tool to use this knowledge in practice. This research will be performed in three steps. First, we focus on creating a framework for defining success in government-driven data ecosystems. Second, we will analyze what configuration of variables contribute to success in government-driven data ecosystems using the qualitative comparative analysis method. Finally, we will develop a tool that will help practitioners configure their own data ecosystem and help them understand the advantages and disadvantages of their choices in advance.\r\nOrganizing this new form of data sharing brings on a whole new level of complexities for governments, for example, the governance of multiple stakeholders, staying within law and ethics, and dealing with technological complexity. Literature on inter-organizational data sharing in data ecosystems and the role of the government in such ecosystems is scarce.  \r\nThis research seeks to contribute to this gap of knowledge and provide literature for further scholars. With the configurational approach, this research aims to create insights into government enabled data ecosystems, where the government has a major role in the data ecosystem and is either receiver or provider of data.  This research looks into the data ecosystems\u2019 design- and context variables, archetypes of data ecosystems and an ecosystem configuration tool, to help public practitioners organize government enabled data ecosystems.\r\n", "date_created": "2021-02-26 15:19:05 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-09-03 13:51:05 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 30}}, {"id": 59508, "grant_number": null, "title": "Adaptive reuse of urban heritage in multicultural societies", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Horizon 2020 DMP", "id": 852527588}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Ana Jayone Yarza Perez"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Ana Jayone Yarza Perez"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2020-06-17 17:19:34 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-06-17 18:39:21 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 71, "answered_questions": 9}}, {"id": 72693, "grant_number": null, "title": "The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on a MOOC in Aerospace Structures and Materials", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Gillian Saunders"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Gillian Saunders"}, "description": "In March 2020 Covid-19 brought the world and with that aviation to a standstill.

This is achieved by inferring statistical models from data, which in turn can be used to predict variables of interest. All but a few interesting problems call for predictions on novel data and thus require these models to generalize learned features, a process tainted with uncertainty. Qualifying predictions under aspects of the inherent predictability of an outcome, also referred to as aleatoric uncertainty, and the uncertainty imposed by an imperfect model, the epistemic uncertainty, is thus a long-standing problem of ever-increasing interest to the field.\r\n\r\nAn interesting problem arises in sequential decision making where learning agents are endowed with the ability to influence future data collections. Reinforcement learning (RL) formalizes sequential decision-making problems as a learning problem of optimal actions under a reward function. In seeking out optimal behavior an agent is required to explore new situations so as to validate the optimality of actions by refining his knowledge of the aleatoric uncertainty governing his world. Epistemic uncertainty then becomes the natural measure of choice to guide an agent through trade offs between (provable) optimality, information gain, and risk.\r\n", "date_created": "2021-08-19 13:00:18 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-09-22 08:25:11 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 8, "answered_questions": 8}}, {"id": 83944, "grant_number": null, "title": "Exploring the Design Space for Period Tracker Technologies", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Alejandra Gomez Ortega"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Alejandra Gomez Ortega"}, "description": "Technologies that measure or collect data about our bodies, feelings, and behaviours are increasingly present in our daily lives. One example of these are menstrual tracking technologies, mostly in the form of smartphone applications, or integrated into health platforms (i.e., Apple Health, Google Health, Fitbit, Garmin), that allow people who menstruate to collect (via self-reporting), analyze, and share information about their menstrual cycle, including pain, sexual activity, sleep patterns, and emotional state. Menstrual tracking technologies are widespread, with over 200 apps available for download, and have been adopted by a wide range of users, for example, the highly ranked apps Flo, and Clue have 40, and 12 million users, respectively. \r\nHowever, the majority of these apps have limited functionalities, and tend to quantify a subjective and complex experience through objective and binary choices (e.g., pain: yes/no), leaving out crucial parts of the experience. Moreover, these apps have proven to be ineffective and inconvenient for those with irregular menstrual cycles, on hormonal birthcontrol, experiencing an abortion, and for those in different stages of their life (e.g., menarche, pregnancy, menopause).\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to critically reflect on menstrual tracking apps and inform the design of near-future period tracking technologies through behavioural data obtained via Data Donation. The first step of the Data Donation process is to explore how potential data donors can gain value and what are effective incentives for participation. This HREC application corresponds to that first step.

A new approach called surface haptics can overcome this limitation by providing the user variable resistance onthe fingertip contacting the interface.  This PhD project will tackle three challenges:\r\n(1) Design a new high-performance surface haptic device that is able to render fine and predictable stimuli. \r\n(2) Model skin mechanics and its influence on limb behavior. \r\n(3) Design and evaluate force fields to improve baseline performance during target reaching (finding an icon) and pursuit (controlling the motion of a virtual object) on surface-haptic devices.

Several technologies can be utilized for efficient consumption of CO2 such as electrochemical, photochemical, radiochemical, biochemical and thermochemical. Among them, electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) powered by renewable electricity on the surface of an electrocatalyst offers a promising approach to convert CO2 into synthetic fuels and create a carbon-neutral cycle. What this cycle needs the most is an electrocatalyst capable of breaking CO2 bonds with lowest energy demand.

For this reason, efficient transport and continuous supply of radioisotopes is essential. This is generally accomplished using the phenomenon of liquid-liquid extraction \u2013 where two fluids are pumped together and the solute dissolved in one fluid is transferred to another. To avoid the flow separation step, the optimal flow conditions involve continuous, stable and parallel flow at the microscale between these two fluids devoid of any leakage of one fluid into another. For this purpose, the interface of the two fluids should be located exactly in the middle of the channel to maximize the purity of obtained radioisotope. The microchannels used for this transport are however, not entirely suited for the task since the appropriate flow conditions required for isotope transport and purification are difficult to achieve. The objective is to study the conditions responsible for interface stability and develop a channel design that achieves a stable interface for the two fluids. The mass transfer of the radioisotopes, in addition to the usage of extractants and reagents, will also be studied, with the aim to determine the chemical composition of the target irradiated material while studying the transport phenomena.

In the current global reality of rapid urbanization, new urban agglomerations emerge, and existing cities get bigger and denser, both demographically and spatially. This results in the formation of metropolises and in positioning them as the prevalent form of human settlement of the 21st century. The accelerated pace of change and growth of metropolises makes them a major arena of crises and uncertainties, setting a real challenge for providing a sustainable, safe, resilient, and inclusive living for all as expected by the global agendas. These become arenas of opportunities in extending beyond the city limits in encompassing urban and rural, culture and nature, and thereby providing scenarios for sustainable futures. In parallel, heritage, the tangible and intangible, becomes an important agent in policy making and planning processes in contemporary cities where there are dramatic socio-economic transformations. The inter-relations between urbanization processes and heritage in the urban areas has the potential for designing and managing the city and the metropolis as a landscape of living heritage. This forms an opportunity for redefinition of the 21st century metropolis, through regional performance, urban-rural networks and urban heritage. Moreover, this aligns to current trends of urban heritage discourses and the strengthening of urban heritage in the metropolis as a generator for sustainable development and of the metropolis, especially under unstable conditions. The research aims to contribute to the field of urban design and planning of metropolises with compounding the tangible heritage with the social transformations of the intangible into planning and decision-making processes, by adapting the HUL approach to the metropolitan scale. Overall, this research aims to contribute for more sustainable metropolitan management and planning through heritage as a generator, as delineated by Goal 11 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030.

As station areas become the new \u201cplaces-to-be\u201d, they create concentrated demand for (clean) energy, water, food, traffic management data, and solutions regarding the produced waste, and equal access to housing and opportunities. How to design transport nodes in a way to guarantee they play a positive role that goes beyond sustaining its own demands, but actually contributing to the regeneration of its immediate context?\r\nBalancing all the demands that come along with designing a transport node and station is a challenge that must be evaluated through a qualitative and quantitative lens. Addressing these demands as parameters for design adds incredible complexity and interdisciplinarity to the task. This means that intuitive design concepts and methods alone cannot assure a solution. In a world of rapid changes and urgent crises, it is paramount to incorporate more strategic and tactical methods, through data-supported design. While these are research topics mostly individually explored, there is an opportunity of investigating how they influence each other, by integrating them in space and form. This exploration is enabled by multi-level analysis methods and parametric modeling, in which computation tools help congregate the emotional and pragmatic dimensions of design.\r\nThis study focuses on investigating transport nodes, to understand how the evolving parameters can be orchestrated to achieve sustainable urbanization. It assumes architecture and urban planning as interdependent fields, of shared scale - and transport nodes as the microcosm of the city. As one of the practical objects of this study, the city of Rotterdam and the station Zuid are examined, in order to understand how design, lifestyle, governance, and their underlying systems are able to be articulated in a way to promote the regeneration of the context where it is inserted.\r\nThe research proposed can serve as a model to be adapted and adjusted to other cities and countries, contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: 11.Sustainable cities and communities, 12.Responsible Consumption and Production, and 13.Climate Action. At the end of this process, there will be a thorough study connecting the disciplines of urban data science, urban studies, and architecture. This research can set a precedent for future transportation node development and a straight-forward framework to guide its performance as a regeneration hub.\r\nKeywords: Data-driven design, Architecture, transport nodes, sustainable urbanization, urban regeneration", "date_created": "2021-09-13 07:54:10 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-09-13 10:08:33 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 24}}, {"id": 83487, "grant_number": null, "title": "NWO Hyper-Realistic Personalized Multisensory Robotic Neurorehabilitation", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": null}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "<p>Every year, millions of stroke survivors lose their functional autonomy due to hand and arm paralysis, posing a tremendous societal and economic challenge. In absence of a cure for stroke, clinical evidence suggests that patients should engage in personalized, task-specific, high-intensity training to maximize their recovery. Additionally, neuroscience suggests that both realistic visual and somatic sensory information play a fundamental role in generating skillful movements. Potentially, rehabilitation robots could provide this, but current robots only provide high-intensity training for non-functional movements, which is neither personalized nor task-specific. First, robots do not adapt the therapy to patients\u2019 particular and dynamic deficits, hampering its effectiveness and putting a tremendous burden on therapists who must handle intricate high-dimensional data to infer therapy recommendations. Second, current robot-aided interventions rely on abstract visual feedback that is cognitively demanding while somatic (tactile and proprioceptive) feedback is underutilized. I propose to radically improve robot rehabilitation, based on a deep understanding of the processes by which somatosensory feedback promotes skill acquisition. First, I will extend the understanding of VR-based techniques, such as the impact of embodiment and the influence of virtual environment\u2019s complexity on patients\u2019 cognitive workload, to design VR that maximizes skill acquisition. Second, I will study the underlying mechanisms by which somatic feedback influences the learning of multi-joint arm movements, and develop new methods for delivering tactile feedback to promote learning to manipulate objects. Third, I will study how to best personalize therapies, combining machine learning techniques with therapist expertise in a Hybrid AI framework. I will exploit these fundamental findings by incorporating immersive VR, augmented somatic feedback, and therapy personalization into a hyperrealistic multisensory robotic neurorehabilitation system (HyPerRealisticRehab), leading to unprecedented levels of improvement in sensorimotor function for a diverse set of patients.

From the consecutive pulses, a spatially detailed set of measurements over large areas is obtained. These\r\nmeasurements consist of water depths (derived from travel times) and back-scatter strengths (derived from echo\r\nintensities). In addition, current MBESs provide an echo envelope per beam. All measurements (depths, backscatter\r\nand echo envelopes) have shown potential for classifying the bed material. However, current single-frequency acoustic\r\nsediment classification is found to not allow for a discrimination between the entire heterogeneity of the sea- or riverbed.\r\nHere, we propose to bring the discrimination power of acoustic classification methods to a next level by making\r\noptimal use of the new multi-spectral MBES capabilities. The approach we propose to realize this huge increase in the\r\ndetail with which the sea- and river-beds can be characterized is two-fold. First, in case the measurements reveal\r\ndepths that differ with frequency, this indicates penetration of the sound into the sediment. This on its turn, allows for\r\nsensing the sediment volume and classifying it based on the MBES measurements and assessing the occurrence of\r\norganisms within the sediment body, such as shellfish or aggregations of other marine species (e.g. Ross worm\r\nSabellaria spinulosa). Second, in areas where all frequencies show similar depths, indicating no penetration and thus a\r\nbed covered with coarse material, the multi-spectral backscatter will be used to maximize the discrimination between bed materials. The goal is to enable characterization of the scales of the bed material, and as such reveal the presence\r\nof shellfish aggregations, while also aiming at a classification based on size. For this, also the raw bathymetric\r\nmeasurements will be used, providing an estimate for bed properties (e.g. roughness). This, however, requires\r\neliminating the intrinsic MBES bathymetric uncertainties, which is part of the proposed research.

Bayesian vector error correction (BVEC) models are able to do so and, as argued by Engle and Yoo (1987), outperform VAR models over longer forecasting horizons.

Social robots will be deployed, in increasing numbers, in assisting health care professionals during the provision of care to patients. While research in Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) has investigated mechanisms for making decisions taken by artificial agents more ethical, there is limited work done in investigating adaptations to HRI that promotes ethical behaviour on the human-side. Moral dilemmas can appear when decisions have to be made regarding patient care. Dealing with them can be challenging for healthcare professionals since the impact of decisions affect multiple parties and involves different considerations and value-trade-offs of the involved people. There are different approaches in which healthcare professionals can be confronted with moral dilemmas. This thesis investigates how a social robot can confront a professional with a moral dilemma and what the associated effects are. We investigate adaptations of audio, verbal and physical cues in healthcare scenarios to promote ethical decision making. The robot displays protests of distress and affect in order to help the professionals carry out systematic reflection of the moral dilemmas they experience. The robots' displays of protest are carried out in three condition settings: (1) non-confrontation scenario, (2) verbal confrontation and (3) affect-based confrontation. The model described makes use of the confrontation scenarios, decision making principles and the Gibbs' Reflective cycle in a medical setting to aid ethical decision making. We applied the socio-cognitive-engineering (SCE) method to develop an assistive robot prototype (Pepper) that incorporates moral confrontation design patterns. Consequently, a perception study is conducted to test these patterns.", "date_created": "2020-05-10 19:11:52 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-07-14 16:35:25 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 69811, "grant_number": null, "title": "Experience Sharing Conversational Agent for Managing Diet", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Avinash Saravanan"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Avinash Saravanan"}, "description": "In this project, a conversational agent for developing a positive diet based habit to help manage type II diabetes is designed, developed, and tested.\r\n\r\nThe conversational agent allows for those who have or are at risk of getting type II diabetes to choose one of three goals and work towards that goal over three sessions with the agent.\r\n\r\nThere are two primary novelties for this system:\r\n\r\n1.

Moreover, the bank holds a big client list of Basic Material Companies that can be a target for applying the circular economy values. In this paper the focus is made on the steel sector on the time frame given from the EU policy, strategy, legislation for 2050 Environment, energy and climate targets. Even though the bank has identified the need for change towards CE, a transition is not trivial. The main question that this research is trying to answer is: How the current institutions incentivize the European banking industry to assist their basic material clients and specific the steel industry to move towards CE. To answer this question a base case of a functional circular steel industry will be developed based on desktop research on the literature of CE. This case will help on deriving questions for semi-structured interviews that will be conducted with stakeholders from the steel industry around the world with the aim to understand their needs. The interviews will provide insights on how different institutions affect the industry to move towards the adoption of CE. The analysis will focus on the economic feasibility of transitioning as well as the institutional change that comes from this transition.

These types of automated decisions affect the lives of citizens and society as a whole. The use and impacts of AI and algorithms are still in its early stages with many challenges, therefore much attention is given to overcome the \u2018black box\u2019 association by developing ethical and fair AI. Nevertheless, the use of AI and algorithms and their ability to process vast amounts of data into outputs currently are expected to decrease the length of decision-making processes, contribute to more accurate decisions, and lower administrative burden. Often the argument for using algorithms in decision-making involves the notion that algorithms make more rational decisions and are less influenced by politics, however, this is too simplistic. Algorithms are not uniform and the use of various algorithms might result into different outcomes and therefore influence the decisions made. Algorithms can introduce inadvertent bias, reinforce historical discrimination, favour a political orientation or reinforce undesired practices. The nature and structure of the algorithms can lead into undesirable prejudices. Unfortunately, the role decision-makers in these processes are often disregarded, as is its explicability. These developments thrive the need for transparency and trust of the underlying complexity of algorithms, the relationship between the used data and the algorithm itself and the general relation between input and output. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of this research project is to analyse the impact of AI algorithms in public decision-making, exploring relationships of influencing elements within algorithmic decision-making. This research proposal encompasses four research questions. The first research question uses systematic literature review in order to classify advantages and disadvantages of AI algorithms, studying its functionalities and rules, benefits and risks, process of modelling, as well the importance of trust and transparency within public decision-making processes and therewith adding to an extensive problem definition. The second research question uses in-depth case studies with the objective to provide an initial understanding of the variation of practices, the roles of different actors and the potential contribution of algorithmic decision-making with societal affects within the public sector (e.g. Netherlands Tax and Customs Administration, several Municipalities and the Central Judicial Collection Agency), exploring and comparing the differences in practices, forms, elements and relations. Within the third research question a quasi-experiment will be conducted to evaluate the difference between a decision made by an algorithm versus a decision where human intervention is practiced on the perceived trust, clarifying the interpretability, transparency and explainability of AI algorithms. The last research question uses the same method to research the use and accuracy of algorithms in public decision-making compared to traditional decision-making, focusing on the accuracy, trustworthiness and capability overcoming discriminatory effects. Testing the (inner) workings of algorithms in a real environment with real issues adds to genuineness of the direct response and usage of the system at work.\r\n\r\nBuilding on empirical findings accumulated from in-depth case studies and quasi-experiments this research project contributes to a perspective on the impact of algorithms on public decision-making within public organisation, deepening the knowledge of the inner workings of algorithmic decision-making in practice on human intervention, trustworthiness, transparency, overall explainability, and accuracy.", "date_created": "2020-04-16 11:35:26 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-05-01 11:07:01 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 81222, "grant_number": null, "title": "3mE-PhD-Computational_Design_of_Origami_Acoustic_Metamaterials_for_Programmable_and_Tunable_Vibration_Isolation", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Plan template (2021) ", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Fred van Keulen"}, "data_contact": {"info": null}, "description": "Origami Metamaterials (MMS), which are inspired by the Japanese art of paper folding, are easy to manufacture.

This sector has seen significant transformations mainly in privatization, liberalization of prices and foreign trade, and liberalization of capital movement. The banking sector continues to transform to attain financial stability for a nation. The crucial shift in the technology landscape led to the introduction of the internet and mobile banking. Such innovative developments need high computing capability, scalability and more secure systems. Cloud computing provides such benefits along with being cost-efficient, more productive and reliable. These advantages are convincing many organizations to move their legacy infrastructure to a cloud environment. But the migration to cloud services is not easy. There are numerous challenges that an organization faces in the migration process. The unique requirements of cloud, elasticity, multi-tenancy, and cloud service selection are not attributed to the legacy systems and raise challenges. \r\nThis research is being done in collaboration with Rabobank, that is a Dutch banking and financial services company located in Utrecht, Netherlands. With the advanced digitization, Rabobank is also planning to move most of its services online and invest more and more in innovation like moving its infrastructure to the cloud for its many benefits like easy accessibility, scalability, and efficient collaboration. They are in the transition phase, or as they call it, \"old to cloud\", initiated with Office 365 in the cloud. Being an organization in the transition phase, Rabobank also faces numerous risks and challenges in going from \"old to cloud\". This leads to the research question: What are the security-related risks and challenges faced by Rabobank in cloud migration?\r\nTo answer this question, a mixed research method research approach is proposed consisting of academic literature review, interviews and group sessions. The literature review will provide an overview of the existing security-related challenges faced during the process of cloud migration. The interviews will be conducted to understand cloud migration at Rabobank and identify the various stakeholders involved. These stakeholders will be interviewed further to understand the higher-level risks in cloud migration at Rabobank. Group sessions will be conducted using the Appreciative inquiry method to understand the issues at a deeper level and gather the requirements for the solutions.

It is important to develop alternative low emission technologies, accordingly.\r\nWithin an economic perspective, Haber-Bosch is only profitable on large-scale due to the expensive\r\nhydrogen production on site. Consequently, the fertilizer distribution is more difficult and costly.\r\nElectrochemical ammonia synthesis, wherein nitrogen, electrons and water reduce to ammonia, shows an\r\nincreased research interest. Implementing this technology on amore local scale would solve the distribution\r\nissue and would produce emission free ammonia. Electrochemical ammonia production is still investigated\r\non lab-scale and faces many challenges. Activating the nitrogen molecule is one of the main challenges in\r\nthe direct electrochemical ammonia research field and is inherently related to the inert nature of dinitrogen.\r\nFirstly, dinitrogen has a strong triple bond with a bond-dissociation energy twice as high as dihydrogen\r\n(EN2 bond = 945 kJ/ mol) and secondly, dinitrogen has no permanent dipole moment. The second research\r\nchallenge is the catalyst selectivity towards ammonia production. Many publications reported very\r\nlow production rates using a pure transition metal as electrocatalyst gaining very low Faradaic efficiencies\r\n(<1%). The dominant side reaction is the hydrogen evolution reaction, which is active on most transition\r\nmetals and has an equilibrium potential close to NRR. The third research challenge is related to\r\nthe difficult quantification of ammonia. External ammonia contamination could originate from the feed-gas\r\nstream, laboratory ambient air or human breath. Even the electrocatalysts and ion exchange\r\nmembranes can already contain ammonia or other nitrogen sources, which can yield ammonia before nitrogen\r\nfixation occurs. The last research challenge is related to nitrogen mass transport limitations\r\ninside liquid phase electrolyzers. Nitrogen dissolves very poorly in aqueous solvents (6.25 mmol/L) and\r\ncould be an important factor for disappointing results. Four research projects will try to tackle these challenges.\r\nNitrogenase is the enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation within all forms of life and is essential for\r\nthe biosynthesis of nucleotides and aminoacids. The active nitrogen reduction part of the enzyme is the\r\nFeMo cofactor. The first research project will synthesize and electrochemically test materials inspired by the\r\nactive parts of the FeMo cofactor. The second research project involves the use of boron-doped materials to\r\nunderstand its HER suppressing abilities and to validate the Lewis-acid and base theory. As electrochemical\r\nperformance in aqueous electrolytes have been disappointing, the third project will study the effect of nonaqueous\r\nsolvents upon the performance of the nitrogen reduction reaction.

Collaboration between clinical researchers, social and data scientists is pivotal to advance this field. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. An example of an AI application is conversational agents that can stimulate conversations with a human. This is an emerging research field within child psychiatry and has been shown to be effective in treating psychological problems. Recent research has revealed that conversational agents facilitate highly satisfactory, helpful and enjoyable user experiences across a variety of domains. However, it is difficult to develop conversational agents that balance medical needs with human values (e.g., engagement and trustworthiness). One research method that has recently flourished in psychiatry is the experience sampling method (ESM). ESM enables the extensive longitudinal measurement of subjective experiences, such as thoughts, feelings and behavior, in individuals\u2019 daily lives. A challenge of ESM is to achieve a high compliance and retention rate, while supporting the values of the participants, e.g., trustworthiness, privacy and relevance. This gap can be bridged by relying on the ethics method of Value Sensitive Design (VSD) to prevent value conflicts and help align multiple considerations. We propose to develop an AI-based conversational agent grounded in ESM and VSD that engages the users and fosters a proactive attitude towards mental health among children (by leveraging customizable and evolving digital avatars, aligning conversational styles, using educational materials, and control mechanisms). The aim of this project is to study whether a conversational agent can increase compliance rates, user experience and engagement, while being trustworthy and promoting human values. The opportunity for convergence that the project seizes is synthesizing the expertise, skillset and knowledge from the medical, ethical and AI domains of the Erasmus MC and TU Delft to design such a conversational agent, while promoting human values.

An ATES system generally comprises a heat pump and two groundwater wells which simultaneously inject and extract groundwater to/from the cold/warm well depending on the season. Despite the fact that these systems significantly reduce the use of primary energy and natural gas, the heat pump requires a considerable amount of electricity to run. The expected large-scale adoption of these systems will require an additional increase in sustainable electricity production (on top of other expected increases in electricity use, e.g. electric vehicles) and require a consequential large-scale adaption of the electricity grid infrastructure. \r\nIn this work, a novel ATES system without a heat pump is proposed which now uses three wells (a triplet), solar heat collectors and a dry cooler. The solar heat collectors are used to warm water to >40\u00b0C when there is incoming solar radiation, which is injected in the warm well; this stored heat can be directly used for heating in winter. Similarly, the dry cooler is used to cool water, which is injected in the cold well in winter; this can be directly used for cooling in summer. After the hot or cold water is used for heating or cooling the building, the water is around 20\u00b0C, and is temporarily stored in a third well, until it can be either heated or cooled as described before. This prevents thermal pollution of the warm and cold wells and avoids the use of heat pumps. The basic working principle shows great potential but needs development on robustness and monitoring and integrated control of the building\u2019s heating and cooling systems, as well as on the processes in the subsurface to ensure system longevity. The efficient use of the three well triplet system  in coordination with the building heating and cooling demand is the key issue for which this research provides solutions. Detailed simulation tools for subsystems are integrated in a hybrid simulation environment. Together with energy demand data of existing buildings these models give insights into the required energy flow of the system, which will then be optimised. Continuous monitoring of set points as well as a Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) system in combination with coupled simulation of the building and subsurface systems are methods used to identify controllers (flows to/from wells, energy balance management charging of warm/cold well) for efficient system operation. \r\nThis research delivers physical and financial constraints within which this technology is suitable, simulation and optimisation tools to assess feasibility for cases and control and simulations tools needed for a first pilot of this system. In this project, the operational phase is directly investigated to ensure robust implementation avoiding barriers to implementation of this concept.

During an online search, warnings and explanations in natural language might support the user to follow the required steps of confirmation bias mitigation\r\nIn this project, we aim to research if confirmation bias during online search can be mitigated with item obfuscation and warning labels. We are going to obfuscate information items that might reinforce previous beliefs and display warnings in natural language, which has to be clicked through to see the information item.\r\nWe expect that confirmation bias during search can be mitigated with item obfuscation and warnings. \r\nTo understand the effectiveness of item obfuscation and warnings in natural language for confirmation bias mitigation during search, we will run controlled randomized experiments where participants will conduct information search without item obfuscation and warning labels (control condition) and with item obfuscation and warning labels (experimental condition). \r\n", "date_created": "2020-12-09 09:27:31 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-12-09 10:57:00 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 71, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 67948, "grant_number": null, "title": "3mE-PhD-Magnetometers for refined localization of equipment for underwater applications", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Frida Viset"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Frida Viset"}, "description": "In this project we will use an array of magnetometers measuring the magnetic field\r\ncombined with inertial sensors and barometers to perform the underwater localization.\r\nThe barometers provide information about the depth, roll and pitch of the sensor setup.\r\nRoll and pitch information can be obtained from the accelerometer.

This trend has been gaining traction within the air traffic control industry as well, with the aim of achieving a high level of automation by the year 2040. However, this means that air traffic controllers will have the role of system supervisors, and will only intervene in exceptional cases. Research shows that this kind of monotonous task leads to a decrease in the cognitive performance of humans, affecting situation awareness and vigilance. One potential solution to this could be found within the concept of gamification: the use of game elements in non-gaming contexts. The research project at hand proposes the introduction of fictional aircraft in the work flow of air traffic controllers. These would populate the radar screen alongside actual traffic, but only the latter would be controlled by automation. The operator would thus be required to supervise air traffic while also controlling fictional aircraft, maintaining engagement and potentially increasing performance in the detection of anomalies as well as in manually controlling traffic in case of failure. An experiment will be performed using MSc students familiar with air traffic control that will seek to compare their supervisory and manual control performance in scenarios where fictional aircraft are lacking, or are present in various density values.

Traditionally, reflex strength was considered to be mediated solely by the spinal cord. However, findings that cortical lesions due to e.g. stroke or Parkinson\u2019s disease, affecting >500.000 people in the Netherlands, result in impaired stretch reflex strength adaptation suggest a critical role for the brain. Currently, neurologists use a reflex hammer to test reflex strength during static posture. This does not allow objective and thorough assessment of reflex strength adaptation during movement. The resulting lack of knowledge on how the central nervous system mediates reflex strength adaptation during movement hampers early diagnosis and design of personalised rehabilitation therapies.\r\nTherefore, I will develop a novel reflex toolbox to disentangle cortical and spinal pathways by combining my experience in control engineering (time-varying system identification techniques), neurophysiology (EEG and EMG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). EEG and EMG allow to identify cortical areas and spinal mechanisms involved during reflex adaptation, which will be provoked using a robotic manipulator during arm reaching in healthy participants. TMS will be used to temporarily deactivate cortical areas and validate how and when each area contributes to reflex adaptation, which has been impossible until today. Finally, clinical feasibility will be demonstrated in stroke patients.\r\nUsing the toolbox, I aim to obtain novel fundamental insights in cortical and spinal pathways responsible for reflex strength adaptation during movement.

On average, health levels in neighbourhoods that were built during the years of the post\u2010war reconstruction (1950\u20101970) lag behind those of other parts of the city. Until recently, this has been explained mainly in terms of their physical qualities (particulate matter, noise), or in terms of the characteristics of the population (lower social status and migrants being more dominant). The effects of the urban layout on the lifestyles of the residents of such neighbourhoods are as yet understudied. There is no doubt, however, that their urban layout promotes unhealthy lifestyles by promoting car dependency; larger distances to facilities, barriers for pedestrians and cyclists caused by main roads cutting through them, etc. Related to that greenery is underused because it is experienced as unsafe. Redesigning the urban lay-out can help to remove negative qualities and foster healthier lifestyles \u2013 hence the name of the project: Urban Design for Improving Health in Groningen (UDIHiG). \r\n\r\nPhase 1 revolved around a pilot project that, amongst other things, developed and consolidated the consortium that with only minor adjustments will execute the so\u2010called research agenda. Phase 2 expands the scope of the research carried out during phase 1. Key to UDIHiG is a multidisciplinary approach that generates optimum synergy between scientific fields of different characteristics \u2013 the health sciences, the design disciplines, change management with a focus on co-creation \u2013 in order to develop a methodology that optimizes the involvement of the residents. Their involvement allows us to integrate their views in the brief for urban interventions and assess the impact of these interventions on lifestyles and health outcomes. Of particular importance is the involvement of urban planners; they introduce intervention techniques from a field that, although health motives played a determining role in its evolution, developed outside the scope of the health sciences; incorporating this domain is in line with the WHO\u2019s \u2018health in all policies\u2019 initiative. The urban interventions are designed by the city architect \u2013 a guarantee of a professional level as well as of the ambition to integrate the findings of the project in future planning projects of the city.\r\n\r\nPhase 2 increases the scope of Phase 1 by\r\n*focusing on the entire neighbourhood (the pilot focused on the shopping centre) \r\n*addressing a wider range of issues that relate lifestyles to the urban layout: access to greenery, the availability of social hubs, etc. (the pilot concentrated on walkability and cyclability) \r\n*targeting all categories of the residents, addressing the full diversity of people living in Paddepoel (the pilot addressed only the elderly)\r\n*refining the assessment process of health effects of urban interventions\r\n*expanding the diagnostic analysis of the neighbourhood\r\n*developing a analysis and intervention model that makes the results of this project applicable in similar neighbourhoods\r\n\r\nPhase 2 envisages five Working Packages (WP\u2019s) which address the following sub-objectives:\r\n1: To optimise diagnostics of urban neighbourhood health and urban environment with regard to the impact of the urban environment on health behaviours and health outcomes (WP1). This will entail spatial analysis of Paddepoel and its use, of demographic data, and of health data;\r\n2. To develop interventions to improve health behaviours by means of a redesign and adaptation of the urban environment (WP2). This will entail a healthy cities literature review, selection of sites, formulation of a design brief, urban design proposals, and their \u2018translation\u2019 in Virtual Reality, and realization of proposed interventions;\r\n3. To enhance participation of residents and other local stakeholders in the analysis of the urban environment and co-create intervention with them by use of virtual reality tools and others innovative methods (WP3). This will entail involvement of the residents in all stages of the project; assessment via Virtual Reality of the urban interventions, and via questionnaires of their expected impact on lifestyles;\r\n4. To disseminate findings to various stakeholders including in particular residents, urban developers, and health professionals who aim to improve health in similarly designed post-war neighbourhoods, this will entail the production of manuals and scientific papers and dissemination to various target groups (WP4);\r\n5. In addition, UDIHiG will have a WP on management (WP5).\r\n\r\nBy scaling up to the basic level of the neighbourhood, UDIHiG addresses the scale that has been identified as the most important for urban public health policies. Our ambition is to underpin the by now generally acknowledged relationship between the urban and public health with hard data derived from a scientifically valid evaluation of lifestyle changes of the residents that increase their health status, thus providing solid ground for health oriented urban interventions.\r\n", "date_created": "2019-12-11 16:39:27 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-03-25 14:57:11 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 14}}, {"id": 66002, "grant_number": "826417", "title": "PhD-EECMS-P2P_Project", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Horizon 2020 DMP", "id": 852527588}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Yang Wu"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Yang Wu"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2020-11-10 12:33:56 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-10 16:24:18 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 71, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 56255, "grant_number": null, "title": "TPM-MSc-Graduation Project [Case Study into Municipal Heat-Transition: Data-Driven Policy-Making Tool]", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Mustika Siti Hajarini"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Mustika Siti Hajarini"}, "description": "The purpose of this research study is to understand the stakeholder requirements on a system design that can be used to support municipal heat transition policy-making.

One such technology, electrochemical CO2 reduction (also known as CO2 electrolyzers), can fill this role by directly converting carbon-dioxide into base chemicals such as carbon-monoxide, ethylene and ethanol, building blocks for many common chemicals and fuels.\r\n\r\nCO2 electrolyzers are still in the early stage of development, however, with almost all current work focussed on finding catalysts which can reduce CO2 with excellent catalytic properties including selectivity, activity and stability. Comparatively little effort has gone into the chemical process design and process intensification of the CO2 electrolyzer reactor itself, which is essential to scale the technology to industrially-relevant sizes (>100 MW) capable of impacting global CO2 emissions. Thus, even if ideal catalysts were discovered tomorrow, we lack the knowledge of how to implement them at a commercial scale.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to change the approach taken by the electrochemical CO2 reduction field by designing and constructing a 1 kW CO2 electrolyzer which is inherently-stable and forms the foundation for further modular scaling. It will be implemented in the following three thrusts:\r\n\r\n\u2022Thrust 1 aims to determine device configurations that demonstrate the best system-wide stability and efficiency, with component integration playing a central role, using a mixed experimentation and modelling approach. \r\n\r\n\u2022Thrust 2 will take these configurations and scale them to 100 cm2 such that the effects of larger scales on process conditions, voltage uniformity and activity can be determined and improved. \r\n\r\n\u2022Thrust 3 will extend the optimal scaled cell into a 1 kW stack design, overcoming both research and engineering obstacles.\r\nIn brief, this project would greatly advance the practicality, scale and engineering design of CO2 electrolyzers while improving performance through component and system integration.", "date_created": "2019-08-08 07:49:31 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-08-20 13:51:09 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 40101, "grant_number": null, "title": "test again H2020", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Nicolas  Dintzner"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Nicolas  Dintzner"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2019-05-06 11:14:15 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-05-27 12:36:43 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 1}}, {"id": 42976, "grant_number": null, "title": "2", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (English)", "id": 2136591626}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Esther Plomp"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Esther Plomp"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2019-07-11 12:39:47 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-07-11 12:39:47 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 48487, "grant_number": null, "title": "PhD Thesis", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Satwik Prabhu Kumble"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Satwik Prabhu Kumble"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2019-11-19 15:10:11 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-11-19 15:42:17 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 12}}, {"id": 58495, "grant_number": null, "title": "SAMEN-WPA-DMP-1", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Nagarjun Reddy"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Nagarjun Reddy"}, "description": "This DMP is for the PhD project (Work Package A of the SAMEN project) at Transport & Planning, CiTG.", "date_created": "2020-06-01 18:01:42 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-06-26 06:28:12 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 57229, "grant_number": null, "title": "Novel Automated ECL Evaluated for Nonnormal Events", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Clark Borst"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Clark Borst"}, "description": "The research aims at developing a new electronic checklist (ECL) to better assist a pilot during nonnormal events (i.e. failures).

The associated pressure on urban space impacts social conditions in cities. In the Netherlands, recent inquiries show that socio-economic inequality among urban citizens has increased in recent years, and that this is accompanied with political and cultural polarization and a risk for societal unrest. Altogether, this emphasize that there is a genuine concern for the social sustainability of cities and urban areas. \r\n\r\nManagement of urban development strives to connect interests and activities of both public and private parties and to integrate wider policy goals, such as social sustainability or climate adaptation, into specific projects \u2013 leading to improved urban living environments. During the recent decades, much attention in both research and practice of urban development has been paid on how to make urban development projects more economically, environmentally and socially sustainable. While theories on the economic and environmental pillars of sustainability have been far-developed, the social pillar remains a challenging pillar to implement in urban development projects. In this research, we promote a novel approach to better understand how social sustainability in urban development can be advanced. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the research is to understand how the governance around urban development projects relate to the implementation of social sustainability in urban areas. This will be analyzed from the normative perspective of the Capability Approach as developed by Amartya Sen. From this perspective, the research defines the outcome of social sustainability as the \u2018real opportunity of a human being to do and to be as a person values\u2019 (i.e. the capability of a person). In this way, the research connects a theory from the field of human development to the field of urban development management, that has previously mainly been studied from the fields of public administration and economics. Through a multiple case-study analysis in West-European cities, the research will identify governance factors of urban development projects that either stimulate or hinder the capability of humans in urban areas. The results will lead to a more comprehensive list of indicators in urban development that relate to the implementation of social sustainability. \r\n", "date_created": "2020-09-21 17:26:31 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-09-22 13:46:31 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 14}}, {"id": 66203, "grant_number": null, "title": "about animal", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "DCC Template", "id": 1638514350}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "yuan yuan"}, "data_contact": {"info": "yuan yuan"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2020-11-13 05:31:31 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-13 05:31:31 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 13, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 60097, "grant_number": "860413", "title": "The Epistemology of Making: dialectics of knowledge in crafts and architecture", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Horizon 2020 DMP", "id": 852527588}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "ERIC CREVELS"}, "data_contact": {"info": "ERIC CREVELS"}, "description": "This research seeks a better understanding of how knowledge is articulated in material production, with a particular focus in the interfaces between architecture and craft and their specific ways of knowing.

As a particular cultural field of expertise in which making and thinking are inextricably linked, standing at the overlaps of design, cultural aesthetics, historical techniques and material production, crafts represent a rich study case on the perspective on knowledge in the material production of architecture. \r\nCentral to these discussions of material productions are questions regarding the different rationalities embedded in making that differ from techno-scientific or academic ones.

By comparing this framework with studies on the architectural field, this research seeks to highlight similarities and divergences between their ways of knowing and making, developing, from this comparison, insights to architectural theory and practice. Finally, these considerations will be brought together in an attempt to develop an initial conceptual framework of a theory of knowledge in the material productions, i.e. an epistemology of making, with particular attention to its tacit dimension.

This is reflected in changing spatial laws (Omgevingswet), that will require participation to be an (significant) element (of the early phases) of the urban development project. Existing research focuses mainly on the effects of participation on the residents, linking it to social sustainability. However, there is a lack of research into the effects of participation on urban redevelopment projects for the developer. Currently, the (positive) effects and implementation of participation within processes of developers is mainly based on \u2018gut feelings\u2019.

The aim of this thesis is to provide insight, based on theoretical and empirical research, on the effects of the voice and influence (participation) of residents on urban (re)development projects. The lessons learned from this research can be applied to future urban development projects. These lessons can help developers, to effectively use participation with residents and create more social sustainable neighbourhoods. The research has three key components: a case study on the effects of participation on urban development projects, a validation of the found effects and an implementation of the findings in practical advice. Two cases from the Dutch developer ERA-Contour, are analysed, on how the participation process was set up and executed, on the GOTIK aspects and on the change in social cohesion of the neighbourhood. Thereafter, the findings of these cases are validated by other Dutch developers in a focus group.

For this reason, IGOAPT is mainly used to treat head and neck (HaN) cancers, where precision is paramount. \r\n\r\nThe treatment adaptation is currently a bottleneck of IGOAPT for multiple reasons. In this project, we deal with the time that it takes the physician to produce clinically acceptable delineations of the tumor and organs at risk, which are the main inputs for the adaptation assessment and plan re-optimization processes. In recent years, AI-based automatic tools for delineating anatomical structures have arisen. Nevertheless, the physician still has to extensively verify their outputs to ensure that the contours are clinically acceptable, which offsets computation time gains that the automatic tools provide.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we aim at addressing this bottleneck by developing a human-centric AI-infused tool for the efficient and accurate delineation of tumors and organs at risk. We will start by characterizing the current radiotherapy workflow, which will help us envisioning more efficient tools and workflows for this task. Next, we will focus on ideating and building the visualization and interaction mechanisms that power the proposed workflow. Finally, we will validate the effectiveness of our prototype, comparing it against current tools and workflows.

We will explore how side-channel and fault injection attacks can be faster, more efficient, and robust when utilizing the AI approach. Additionally, since the evaluation phase of devices is influenced by a subjective perception of a person conducting the evaluation, we will explore how AI methods can make the evaluation human error-free.\r\n \r\nConsequently, successful enhancement of the mentioned attacks will make current devices insecure and unreliable, but it will also force designers and engineers to again develop new countermeasures and make the devices more secure for the current era of AI attacks. This is an ongoing process between research on exploiting vulnerabilities and implementing countermeasures, and it could lead to more secure smart devices that people can trust.\r\n \r\n", "date_created": "2020-10-12 12:33:50 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-10-15 14:21:06 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 62541, "grant_number": "869283", "title": "CEG-PhD- Assessment and management of health and quality risks for (waste)water reuse and resource recovery", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "arianna nativio"}, "data_contact": {"info": "arianna nativio"}, "description": "Water is the most important resource for the humankind.

Indeed, catalysts decrease the energy needed for molecules to react with each other. To achieve a carbon neutral chemical industry, drastic energy reductions and production of chemicals from renewable feedstocks are needed. The development of new catalysts will play a vital role here.\r\nA Holy Grail in catalysis is the development of solid catalysts by design. To achieve this goal, we need precise molecular insight in the reaction mechanism. Yet, thus far it\u2019s only possible to probe long-lived intermediates. Thus, we rely on computational models which are coloured by our assumptions. This proposal seeks to experimentally unravel the pathway of catalytic reactions via achieving for the first time the required ultrafast time resolution.\r\nI will achieve a time resolution of tens of picoseconds via the photothermal effect: absorption of short femtosecond light pulses by plasmonic particles create rises in temperature of hundreds \u00b0C\u2019s within this timeframe. These heat pulses will kick-start the catalytic reaction, after which our spectroscopic chronometer can start running. A pump-probe scheme will ensure the required time resolution, sensitivity and selectivity.\r\nAs the plasmonic particles should only heat, I will encase them in an inert shell. For catalyst particles directly positioned on the encased nanoheaters and for physical mixtures of both, I will probe the photothermally induced heat profile on the catalyst surface. As proof-of-principle, I will detect the short-lived intermediates and their kinetics during hydrogenation of formic acid over supported metal catalysts. Finally, I focus on activation of a relatively inert molecule CO2, which will be key in establishing a sustainable chemical industry. \r\nThe detailed molecular picture of the reaction pathway that can be obtained via this new method, should enable the development of new and improved catalytic processes.

Since these resources are fluctuating, forecasts for renewable energy sources (RES) are crucial for an efficient operation of the power system. For a large part, forecasting of renewable energy production relies on the output from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. NWP models operate at coarse mesh sizes that cannot resolve turbulence, which is one of the key processes affecting wind and clouds alike. This leads to systematic biases, most notably an overestimation of solar radiation in the presence of low (stratus) clouds, and a severe underestimation of the wind speed during the night. Both situations are frequently occuring weather conditions.\r\nLarge-eddy simulation (LES) models apply a high spatial resolution (~10-100m) which is sufficiently fine to resolve turbulence. LES modeling is an established, yet computationally expensive technique. Recently a giant gain in the computational speed was obtained by running LES on a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), which nowadays allows the TU Delft spin-off company Whiffle to operate it as a high-resolution weather forecast model. The GPU\u2010Resident Atmospheric Simulation Platform (GRASP) receives the large-scale forcing conditions from the European Weather European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF) model. The full potential of LES-based forecasts is however not acquired since the initial state, which is also taken from the ECMWF model, contains errors.\r\nWith REFORM, we aim to improve weather forecasts of solar radiation and wind up to 6 hours ahead by introducing a novel, hybrid approach which makes use of GRASP as well as observations to obtain the best possible estimate of the initial atmospheric state in terms of wind, temperature, humidity and clouds. We will capitilize on the recently initiated national observational platform Ruisdael, which includes ground-based in-situ measurements as well as advanced remote sensing retrievals. To fully exploit the capabilities of GRASP the proposed research will strongly focus on turbulent regimes such as the nocturnal stable boundary layer, the clear convective boundary layer, their transitions, and low clouds. The improvement of the forecast skill will be quantified from the observations.

Decomposition in planning could lead to sub-optimal solutions and neglecting crucial inter-dependencies.

First, using agents' local attributes, the framework can capture inter-dependencies among sub-problems in a significant detail level. Secondly, maintain a well-balanced trade-off between the framework's scalability and final solution quality thanks to agents' local computation capabilities. Finally, this framework could be used as a what-if scenario testbed with limited input changes to evaluate new technology's adaption consequences.

It has many complications and its treatment consists of dieting, physical activity, taking medication, injecting insulin and more. These activities can cause discomfort at both physical and psychological level. For example, a patient with a very low blood sugar can look like a drunkard, causing embarrassment. Research also shows that they tend to feel excluded because they cannot participate in every social event, especially when food is involved. \r\n\r\nFor this research, a conversational agent will be designed and implemented. This agent will interact with the social environment of the patient because research has shown that family members with high diabetes knowledge and supportive behaviour will lead to better glucose management. \r\nThis research is in the starting phase. We want to organise a focus group in order to get a better picture of what problems people with diabetes and their social group are dealing with and to find out what solutions they might have for their problems. Before the focus group starts, participants are asked to fill in an informed consent form, stating that they have the right to stop participating at any moment and that their data will be deleted upon request. \r\n\r\nWe created scenarios where we introduce a set of problems in order to get the conversation going. We ask participants what data they would (not) share with their social environment and what data a conversational agent should (not) share. For example, would participants be willing to share blood sugar levels with their family members? And what about emotional status? During the focus group, we will gather possible problems and solutions to those problems or other interesting facts with which the participants come up with. \r\n\r\nTo set up a focus group, the researcher will approach people with diabetes and their social group via email. Contact information will be obtained from the researcher\u2019s personal connections, by using websites where patients can share experiences with each other on fora (diabetestype1.nl or diabetestrefpunt.nl) or by getting patient contact details via Diabetes Fonds, an organisation which is also involved in the PAL project.

While these machine learning applications are aimed at helping governmental agencies improving services to citizens, these applications also impose risks on society.  Risks regarding privacy, autonomy and equalityare linked to the misuse of machine learning, which are weighty values in Western democracies. Following from these risks, some governmental organisations are hesitant to use machine learning, leading to missed chances at improving service towards citizens. Public supervisory agencies serve an important role in mitigating the risks of machine learning by holding governmental agencies accountable for their use,  or misuse,  of machine learning applications. Their  supervision  can  in  turn  increase  trust  in  governmental  use  of  machine  learning,  leading  to  a decrease in underuse for organisations previously hesitant towards using machine learning. Currently, scientific literature does not provide the needed knowledge for supervisory bodies to ensure thorough and effective supervision on machine learning applications.  Filling this knowledge gap will help supervisory bodies with their supervisory tasks regarding machine learning, which will in turn counteract the misuse and underuse of machine learning at governmental agencies.The knowledge needed for supervising machine learning applications will be acquired by following the  design  science  research methodology as proposed by Peffers et al.

Upon their\r\nuptake into host cells, intracellular pathogens frequently shelter inside a membrane-delimited compartment, which acts as\r\na physical barrier to their recognition and elimination by pathogen sensor molecules. A cellular host defense system driven\r\nby GTP-powered enzymes of the guanylate binding protein (GBP) family can attack these compartments and sever their\r\nmembranes, thus shattering the shelter and exposing the pathogens to the intracellular immune surveillance and\r\nelimination systems.

Using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and\r\nelectron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) we aim to understand the mechanism by which these membranolytic enzyme\r\nassemblies attack and disrupt intracellular pathogen compartments.

We will design and develop an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) for selecting individual elements, amplifying the weak receive signals, and achieving data reduction. To cover a central frequency range from 3.5-7 MHz, we will use differently tuned elements for the piezo array and apply the frequency tuning capability of the CMUT elements.\r\nThe transducer will enable ultrafast 3D imaging and harmonic imaging, which is mandatory for detailed spatial and temporal analysis of the carotid and aorta.

A sudden authority transfer demands the driver to take control without building enough situational awareness, resulting in the driver's delayed response. If the system requires a take-over, lost situation awareness must be regained to perform safe and comfortable authority transition. Haptic shared control provides the interface that sets up proper communication between the human driver and the system, letting the driver know the intent of automation on time. Therefore, this research project explores Haptic Shared Control as a safer transition approach. The study aims to investigate whether Haptic Shared Control improves the take over performance in unplanned takeovers, as compared to Traded Control. A driving simulator study will be conducted where participants (30 expected) will drive four trials. Each trial consists of 1 hazard detection scenarios.

This data can be used to predict when a component will fail. For example, an increase in the pressure of a component might indicate an upcoming failure. The first goal of my PhD is to develop probabilistic predictions about the failure time of components using this sensor data. The second part consists of using those predictions to actually plan maintenance. Here, we plan when a component should be replaced while taking various things into account, such as available spare parts, avaible maintenance slots, other (urgent) tasks etcetera.

Possible applications of so called Very Large Floating Structures (VLFS) are numerous and fueled among others by the needs of a growing population and energy consumption. Due to the size of VLFS and the fact that the majority of these structures are relatively rigid, deformations of these structures are on a small scale and a pure linear elastic response is assumed.As a wider spectrum of flexibility for floating structures get considered going forward, considerations of a viscoelastic response of VLFS to propagating ocean waves become necessary to determine the structures deflection. The influence of a (turbulent) boundary layer beneath the viscoelastic covers is believed to be the major contributor to the mismatch. The interactions between a flexible or compliant surface and propagating waves involve complex two-coupled fluid-structure interactions that will be experimentally investigated during this PhD project.", "date_created": "2020-12-14 13:52:05 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-09-13 13:06:05 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 71503, "grant_number": null, "title": "Mechanosensitive behaviour of single molecules", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Sebastiaan van der Poel"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Sebastiaan van der Poel"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-02-15 09:41:03 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-04-08 14:09:04 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 9}}, {"id": 70792, "grant_number": null, "title": "Diana's Plan", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Diana Popa"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Diana Popa"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2021-02-03 09:15:35 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-02-03 09:39:26 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 1}}, {"id": 71675, "grant_number": null, "title": "Interview for master thesis: Agile metrics", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Pravesh Moelchand"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Pravesh Moelchand"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-02-16 15:59:59 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-02-19 02:43:39 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 7}}, {"id": 60647, "grant_number": null, "title": "LR PhD Thesis Project - Caroline Houriet", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Caroline Houriet"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Caroline Houriet"}, "description": "LR PhD Thesis Project - Caroline Houriet\r\n\r\nThis work opens the possibility to manufacture three-dimensional complex shapes with tailored anisotropic paths generated with concurrent-Topology and Anisotropy-Optimization (TAO) algorithms.

Assisted living in home environments is considered as primary scenario, but the approaches and findings of our project can influence the wider radar sensing field, including outdoor surveillance scenarios and other classes of targets (e.g. automotive, ships, drones and UAVs, larger aircraft).\r\nThe ambition is to design and validate \u201cradar-aware\u201d approaches that can account for the specific nature of continuous and correlated sequences of radar data, and incorporate domain-specific and contextual knowledge into the core of the classification networks proposed. Rather than simply adapting networks designed for other data such as audio, natural language, or video processing, this requires fundamental research to understand, model, and capture the intrinsic kinematic information encoded in the sequence of radar data, which is strongly related to the movements of people observed. \r\nTo enable interpreting the radar data as a continuous sequence of temporal information, rather than artificial \u201csnapshots images\u201d that cut arbitrarily the sequence of data, the development of new architectures based on temporal-convolutional and bi-directional recurrent networks is investigated. This will help us analyse continuous sequences of diverse human activities from body macro-movements to micro-movements of gestures, where the transitions between them can happen at random times and each activity has non-predefined duration. This is a step forward compared to the state of the art in radar, where human motions have been typically observed as separate, distinct movements, classified by standard convolutional networks.\r\nA further challenge is to incorporate kinematic and contextual information into the proposed networks through the usage of memory and attention mechanisms. The modelling and addition of this extra kinematic knowledge will help make the decision process of the networks more explainable, thus reducing the \u201cblack-box perception\u201d of the approach that may hinder its usage. Furthermore, this will avoid resorting to very deep networks in \u201cend-to-end learning\u201d frameworks, for which it is unfeasible to obtain sufficient experimental radar data for training. \r\nThe project will combine theoretical modelling work in developing innovative classification algorithms specifically suitable for sequential radar data, and experimental work to validate the approach with mm-wave radar. This is selected for its wide signal bandwidth so that the sequential data investigated for activities and movements classification can be taken not only in the Doppler/micro-Doppler domain, but directly in the range domain benefitting from fine resolution.

They are valuable heritage properties to many local and global communities, attracting efforts to conserve them. Nonetheless, development has been considered as one of the main challenges to the WHCs conservation. The 2011 UNESCO Recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape (HUL approach) proposes an integral approach, interlinking urban development, and conservation, foreseeing to promote more sustainable development. According to the HUL approach, public participation plays an essential role in consensus-building among the varied stakeholders on related decision-making processes, including on what should be protected (attributes) in their city and why (values). Although the HUL approach seeks to increase the sustainability of planning and design interventions along with local community values, it does not specify how to engage stakeholders nor sheds new light on factors affecting their participation. As an international recommendation, it would be controversial to give a roadmap for local contexts; however, this is a gap that this research will tackle. Another moving forward is that it does reference the aim for consensus anchored to the cultural significance (attributes and values) of the city among stakeholders. The central gap in the literature is limited work towards reaching consensus on Outstanding Universal Value (OUV). This leads us to the hypothesis that there is little consensus between the key stakeholders on the OUV. Although OUV implies that there is already an international consensus as different countries agreed with the inscription on the WH List. Given that, the goal of this study is to research a maximum consensus on values between the key stakeholders. This research proposal will develop and implement a public participation method to reach a maximum consensus on the values of the windcatchers that marks the skyline of the Historic City of Yazd in Iran. There is a wide range of methods that have been used to reach a consensus on values. This research will collect qualitative and quantitative data from social media, literature, and policy documents to analyze the opinions of the main interest groups. Two Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, topic classification, and sentiment analysis will be used to reveal the conflicts and similarities of the values and attribute associated with windcatchers according to the interest groups. The aim is to reveal the stakeholders' conflicts and similarities in how they value windcatchers. Later in an interactive workshop, this study will validate its findings in order to reach a maximum consensus on the sustainability of windcatchers. Lastly, these shared values will be compared with the current OUV on windcatchers. As a result, this research aims to contribute to state of the art by shedding light on digital tools to enrich step two of the HUL approach \u2013 consensus-building \u2013 in order to be replicated to other attributes in Yazd and also in other WH properties.

There is an urgent need for cost-efficient and CO2-neutral technologies that can make additional water resources available. Combining wind energy with seawater desalination is a promising option for coastal areas and islands to mitigate CO2-emissions. However, there is a mismatch between the operation of a wind turbine (subject to the stochastic nature of the wind) and that of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) that normally operates at steady conditions. Presently, this mismatch is mediated by an electrical power conversion. An alternative solution is to eliminate the conversion to electrical energy by direct coupling of a hydraulic wind turbine to an SWRO. A pressure exchanger as energy recovery device (ERD) can further improve the power transfer from turbine to SWRO. The goal is to develop a time domain numerical model that simulates the behaviour of the wind powered desalination plant when subject to the environmental wind loading. The numerical model will also allow to evaluate the controllability of the hydraulic drivetrain in combination with the SWRO plant. The same concept can be applied to the desalination of seawater driven by hydrokinetic devices (tidal turbines).  \r\n", "date_created": "2020-11-18 09:39:23 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-18 10:46:51 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 5}}, {"id": 53824, "grant_number": null, "title": "Test NWO-new template", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "NWO Data Management Plan (January 2020)", "id": 1506827492}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Yan Wang"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Yan Wang"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2020-03-02 10:37:36 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-03-02 10:37:36 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 48497, "grant_number": null, "title": "RDM Training 19th Nov", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Santosh Ilamparuthi"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Santosh Ilamparuthi"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2019-11-19 15:11:33 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-11-19 15:11:33 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 67049, "grant_number": null, "title": "Esther2", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1753695087}, "funder": {"name": "Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)"}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Esther Plomp"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Esther Plomp"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2020-11-25 12:26:19 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-25 12:26:19 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 41276, "grant_number": null, "title": "I-SURF", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Claudiu Forgaci"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Claudiu Forgaci"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2019-05-31 10:51:04 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-05-31 10:59:42 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 7}}, {"id": 52469, "grant_number": null, "title": "Master Thesis Physical Internet", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Sharon van Luik"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Sharon van Luik"}, "description": "The physical internet is an analogy between the digital internet and the logistics web.

It has been estimated that around 94-220 million people worldwide have been exposed to groundwater with toxic As concentrations (Podgorski & Berg, 2020). In water sources, As is mainly present in two inorganic forms: arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V) (Wan et al., 2011), with the As(III) species being more toxic and more prevalent in reduced groundwater aquifers than As(V) (Katsoyiannis & Zouboulis, 2004; Nicomel et al., 2015). Chronic exposure to As in drinking water causes various diseases, such as skin, bladder and lung cancers, reproductive disorders and neurodevelopmental disease in children (Kapaj et al., 2006; Tseng, 1977). Hence, it is essential to remove As from contaminated water meant for drinking purposes, with the provisional drinking water guideline of 10 \u00b5g/L set by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2004). \r\nMany techniques have been proposed to remove As from drinking water, such as coagulation and flocculation, ion exchange, adsorption to activated alumina or iron based sorbents and reverse osmosis (Feenstra et al., 2007; Mondal et al., 2013). However, these techniques are not very efficient to remove As (III), which is mainly present in raw groundwater (Katsoyiannis & Zouboulis, 2004). The efficiency of these techniques is improved by pre-oxidation of the neutral As(III) species to the negatively charged As(V) oxyanion (H2AsO4-/HAsO42-) (Goren et al., 2020; Kim & Nriagu, 2000), which is removed more readily by ion exchange, precipitation and adsorption (Kumar et al., 2004; Wan et al., 2011). Hence the conventional As removal techniques go for pre-oxidation of As(III) for efficient removal.  Effective As(III) oxidation can be performed with chemical oxidants, including O3, NaClO and KMnO4 (Kim & Nriagu, 2000; Sorlini & Gialdini, 2010). However, chemical oxidants can be expensive and can generate unwanted by-products (Jackman & Hughes, 2010) that require additional treatment, which increases the cost and complexity of treatment (Katsoyiannis & Zouboulis, 2004). Further, the conventional separation techniques are subjected to other drawbacks like lower removal of As (III), consumption of chemicals, high operating cost, handling of secondary pollutants, etc (Song et al., 2017) Hence, new methods are needed that can overcome the drawbacks of conventional methods to oxidize and remove As(III).\r\nOn the above context, the biological oxidation of As(III) by groundwater native arsenic oxidizing bacteria (AsOB) can be taken as an advantageous alternative to chemical oxidation (Kamei-Ishikawa et al., 2017). After biological As(III) oxidation, an additional treatment step is subsequently required to remove the dissolved As(V). One low-cost and chemical-free method is Fe(0) electrolysis, also known as iron electrocoagulation (FeEC), which involves in-situ generation of Fe(III) precipitates to potentially bind As (Holt et al., 2005; Mollah et al., 2004; Moussa et al., 2017). \r\nAlthough many efficient technologies have been reported to treat As contaminated water, however, the simplest method will be to take advantage of the natural dissolved Fe(II), which often present in high-arsenic anoxic groundwater (Nickson et al., 1998; Tong et al., 2016). The anoxic groundwater after abstraction is subjected to aeration-filtration step generally that result in the formation of hydrous ferric oxides (HFOs) due to Fe(II) oxidation and these HFOs can act as adsorbents for As. However, studies has shown that the available natural Fe is not sufficient or under-utilized to remove the As(III) (Hug et al., 2008), which is main As species in raw groundwater. The main reason is that the air-oxidation step results in fast oxidation of Fe(II) (generating HFOs) but not As(III) (as air oxidation of As(III) is very slow) resulting in lower adsorption of the neutral As(III) on the HFOs. Study by Ahmad et al., (2020) has shown that presence of As(III) restricts the efficiency of As removal by the HFOs whereas when the As(III) is completely oxidized the uptake of As by the HFOs increased. Hence if we can co-oxidize Fe(II) and As(III) anoxically before the aeration-filtration step then the use of the natural Fe(II) can be optimized for As removal. One such chemical-free method to co-oxidize As(III) and Fe(II) under anoxic condition will be by in-situ generation of  H2O2 electrochemically by passing current through an air-cathode. Application of air-cathode has been employed recently in FeEC (Bandaru et al., 2020; Si et al., 2017) and the technique showed efficient oxidation and removal of As(III) simultaneously under oxic oxidation. Hence application of an air-cathode on the anoxic groundwater before the aeration filtration step can optimize the use of natural Fe for As(III) removal and can further reduce the amount of additional Fe required to get the desired As removal\r\n", "date_created": "2020-12-08 08:45:16 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-12-08 13:54:23 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 15}}, {"id": 65723, "grant_number": null, "title": "LR PhD Thesis Project - Paul Gradl", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Paul Gradl"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Paul Gradl"}, "description": "It is hypothesized that directed energy deposition additive manufacturing technology can be used for fabrication of heat exchangers with integral micro-channels with controlled flow similar to traditional fabrication techniques.

On the other hand, methods relying on Aurora A kinase require using egg extracts in which the nucleation of microtubules is a result of contribution of several proteins, without having a clear insight of the exact mechanisms at work. Here we propose DNA-conjugated stabilized microtubule seeds as a programmable nucleation site and DNA origami as a frame to control the position of seeds. The DNA origami platform would be synthesized by the well-established protocols described in previous studies, containing extruding single stranded oligos complementary to the ss-DNA on the surface of modified microtubule seeds. This method could be utilized to reconstitute microtubule asters originating from an optical or magnetic tweezer bead in purified in-vitro assays in order to gain spatial control over artificial microtubule organizing centers. The programmability of microtubule nucleators, on the other hand, provides an extra orthogonal degree of manipulation on the properties of such asters.

To address deep sustainable transitions transdisciplinary and interprofessional approaches need to transcend current knowledge domains to develop new actions, interventions and strategies. Yet, evidence shows that transforming disciplinary and professional knowledge domains remains weak as domains still operate within established language, interpretive and pragmatic boundaries. Disciplines and professions must change behaviour to challenge these boundaries to achieve \u2018deep transdisciplinary and interprofessional learning\u2019. This proposal responds to this challenge by asking two questions on deep learning for deep sustainable transitions: how can professional actors (micro), sector-based organisational actors (meso), and place-based actor networks (macro) drive deep transdisciplinary and interprofessional learning to co-create solutions for deep sustainable transitions, and; how do these actors overcome emergent paradoxes in deep transdisciplinary and interprofessional learning? To answer these, action research will take place in two urban living laboratories \u2013 Havenstad Amsterdam and Rotterdam Makers District to co-produce knowledge on triggers and barriers to deep transdisciplinary and interprofessional learning, and identify promising practices for overcoming emergent paradoxes to break down language, interpretive and pragmatic boundaries. The consortium will also evaluate how deep transdisciplinary and interprofessional learning can produce innovative solutions for deep sustainable transitions. The consortium will create a legacy archive of documentary evidence from systematic review, observational fieldnotes, archival analysis, interviews and reflective practitioner accounts to drive curriculum development for educating future professionals working in sustainable transitions.", "date_created": "2020-07-01 09:50:53 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-07-01 10:03:43 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 48496, "grant_number": null, "title": "Testing_my_PhD", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Jingchu He"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Jingchu He"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2019-11-19 15:11:22 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-11-19 15:44:16 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 8}}, {"id": 58255, "grant_number": null, "title": "Flow and sediment processes over side weirs", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Ana Luisa Castanon"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Ana Luisa Castanon"}, "description": "The research will be focused on understanding the sediment partitioning at the Longitudinal Training Walls such as the one built in the Waal River.

Behaviour has a high variety of influencing factors, including the composition and experience of the physical environment. The main research question for this thesis is: What spatial interventions in the system of public spaces could stimulate adolescents in Westland, the Netherlands, to become more physically active? To be able to understand adolescents' demands of an active friendly public space, a digital questionnaire is set up. The results will enable an assessment of the existing public space in Westland on its fitness for adolescent physical activity behaviour.

However, Cr (VI) inhibitors lead to health hazards and the risk of cancer, which means that the alternative inhibitors are desired to replace Cr (VI). \r\nThe main challenges in corrosion inhibiting coatings are: (1) The reduction/suppression of the negative inhibitor-organic coating interactions; (2) The release control of inhibitors; (3) The development of inhibiting systems leading to very stable protective layers on the surface to provide efficient long-term corrosion protection. In our previous work, mineralized diatom exoskeletons (i.e. diatomite), which are highly nanoporous microparticles with a hollow inner pill-box structure, were used as carriers for corrosion inhibitors in anticorrosive coatings. The approach could reduce the coating-inhibitor negative interactions, allow local high inhibitor loading and facilitate diffusion-controlled time-based release of inhibitors from the coatings at a damage location. Our past works demonstrate the proof of concept but showed there is ample space for improvement of the concept.\r\nThe goal of the project is to push the diatomite-based technology several steps forward towards application and to understand the complex inhibitor-carrier-coating-metal interactions. \r\n", "date_created": "2020-10-23 11:30:11 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-26 14:37:27 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 64039, "grant_number": null, "title": "Passenger\u2019s activities, posture and dis(comfort) perception while traveling by train.", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Sumalee Udomboonyanupap"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Sumalee Udomboonyanupap"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2020-10-06 02:56:32 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-10-06 02:56:32 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 62011, "grant_number": null, "title": "Yasemin's Plan", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "ERC DMP", "id": 1547549517}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Yasemin Turkyilmaz-van der Velden"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Yasemin Turkyilmaz-van der Velden"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2020-08-19 09:15:50 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-08-19 09:15:51 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 8, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 49103, "grant_number": null, "title": "PhD - EEMCS - PhD training 2019 2nd December", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Yan Wang"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Yan Wang"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2019-12-02 10:11:26 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-12-02 10:21:47 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 2}}, {"id": 71710, "grant_number": null, "title": "CEG-PhD-this is my demonstration", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Kees den Heijer"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Kees den Heijer"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-02-17 09:48:34 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-02-17 09:49:28 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 46242, "grant_number": null, "title": "EuroMagick", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "ERC DMP", "id": 1547549517}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "J Love"}, "data_contact": {"info": "J Love"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2019-10-04 12:47:37 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-10-30 16:02:05 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 8, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 45438, "grant_number": null, "title": "sdasdsa", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (English)", "id": 2136591626}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Santosh Ilamparuthi"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Santosh Ilamparuthi"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2019-09-17 08:07:31 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-09-17 08:07:31 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 44262, "grant_number": null, "title": "Esther's Plan", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (English)", "id": 2136591626}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Esther Plomp"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Esther Plomp"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2019-08-14 17:05:00 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-08-14 17:05:00 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 49095, "grant_number": null, "title": "PhD-EEMCS-BiasInDataDrivenDecisionSupportSystems", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Agathe Balayn"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Agathe Balayn"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2019-12-02 10:09:29 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-12-02 11:06:03 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 14}}, {"id": 42445, "grant_number": "824292", "title": "AW - Drones ", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Horizon 2020 DMP", "id": 852527588}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Marta Ribeiro"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Marta Ribeiro"}, "description": "The lack of clear standards is holding back the development of drone-related business, both at a global level and in Europe.

A large part of this population lives in India. The Lancet, WHO, and the World Bank recently showed that many essential surgical interventions are not only very cost-effective in resource-poor countries, but will bring economic growth. However, due to lack of equipment, instruments and infrastructure, low-recourse settings face many challenges that require innovation. \r\nMinimally invasive surgical techniques bring many advantages for patients, especially in low-resource settings, because of e.g. a reduced risk of infection and shorter hospital stays. Unfortunately, the currently used devices are expensive and difficult to clean, and require a sterile operating-room environment.  \r\nWe propose to develop an innovative SMART surgical equipment system, where SMART stands for Safe, Minimal dimensions, Affordable, Reliable and Transparent (=easy to use). The system will allow minimally invasive surgery without the need for a sterile operating room, even in low-resource settings. We will use a human-centric design approach and co-creation involving clinicians, designers, entrepreneurs and engineers to develop deflectable, easy-to-manufacture, easy-to-use and easy-to-clean instruments based on a new rotating shaft (SATA) principle, an isolator system to protect the incision and instrument shaft from (dirty) open air, and other affordable equipment needed.  Prototype testing will be done together with clinical groups in India, (new) spin-off companies and surgical device certification experts. After testing, the developed instruments will be ready for full-scale clinical testing. \r\nThe SMART surgical system will change the way surgery can be performed in low-resource settings, making minimally invasive surgery accessible for patients all over the world.\r\n", "date_created": "2018-07-16 15:17:10 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-08-23 15:46:17 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 62, "answered_questions": 31}}, {"id": 25159, "grant_number": null, "title": "abc", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "Datamanagement ZonMw", "id": 1578670026}, "funder": {"name": "ZonMw (Nederlands)"}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Jasmin K.

The proposed DCFC is expect to handle the rapidly increasing EV charging demand with multiple features.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the incorporation of intermittent renewable energy sources into the grid, specially based on wind and solar, is dramatically increasing. Additionally, the great usage of Electric Vehicles (EV) which constitutes an unpredictable high power peak load. This can lead to grid stability issues and lower availability of energy for other loads. Therefore, the inclusion of energy storage elements into the EV charger is proposed in this project to solve these potential problems.\r\n\r\nMoreover, to counter act to the expected reduction of governmental subsidies and consequent increment of the charging cost, the system can incorporate energy storage into the inner DC grid. This is advantageous to buffer the power demand from the AC grid and to reduce energy consumption costs. The usage of such technologies can help to lessen undesirable effects on the AC grid caused by recurrent high power demand from the fast EV charging process. Additionally, with enough storage capacity the proposed EV infrastructure can participate in the ancillary services markets, providing services to the public AC grid such as frequency balancing, voltage control and congestion management. The sizing of energy storage and the type of ancillary services provision versus the required investments on improving AC grid infrastructure constitutes an economic optimization problem which is dependent of several factors within the energy market, i.e. energy tariffs, monetary compensation in the ancillary service market, governmental subsidies, among others.\r\n\r\nThe challenges of this project lies in :\r\n\r\nSelection of suited AC/DC converter for proposed modularized DCFC with features such as multi-ports and multiplexing.\r\nSelection of suited AC interfaced filters to satisfy the high power density demand while maintaining better performances (harmonics, control stability)\r\nOptimized sizing the integration of energy storage with considerations such as power level of charger, grid power quality and stability and economic aspects (from point of view of DC grid).\r\nThe laboratory scale demonstrator of 10 kW charger with the integration of energy storage  will be developed and tested.", "date_created": "2019-12-03 10:18:04 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-12-03 11:00:51 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 8}}, {"id": 49957, "grant_number": null, "title": "Analysis of the relation between student group performance and the project manager's role and competences", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Hans Wamelink"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Hans Wamelink"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2019-12-16 20:06:26 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-01-14 15:01:10 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 14}}, {"id": 52049, "grant_number": "VI.Veni.192.259", "title": "Composable and Safe-by-Construction Programming Language Definitions", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (English)", "id": 2136591626}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Casper Bach Poulsen"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Casper Bach Poulsen"}, "description": "Type-checked languages are invaluable tools for developing complex software because they automatically guarantee the absence of certain errors.

And if so, how do they customize their service style and manage their own mood?

As mood is an affective state which each individual experience differently, the interval and even contingent experience sampling method will be used which allows participants to report their experiences at pre-determined intervals (2 times every working day for 5 work days) and at prespecified events (whenever they notice a mood-sensitive encounter). The participants will be asked to note down their encounters with clients which they consider to be mood-sensitive. They will note down how they recognize the mood of the customer, which mood they are in themselves, what kind of strategy they use to adjust their service to the mood of the clients mood. They will additionally be asked to note down the products in use if that is the case during the encounter which contributes to the mood-sensitive interaction and make a photograph of that product. \r\n\r\nFor that, first, the participants will be introduced to the study materials and guided through the questions to clarify the experience collection for half an hour.

Establishing enhancer-promoter contacts can be facilitated by the loop extrusion activity of SMC proteins, especially cohesin. Experimental evidence at the single molecule level for or against such a view is, however, currently lacking.\r\nBuilding upon existing single molecule visualization assays for DNA loop extrusion by SMC proteins in the lab and recent experiments using nuclear extracts, this proposal aims to explore the role of SMC-mediated enhancer-promoter contacts in transcriptional activation in vitro. Of particular interest is if a physical contact between enhancer and promoter regions is necessary and/or sufficient to initiate gene transcription. Furthermore, the kinetic aspect of extruding transcription factor-bound regulatory regions into loops will be probed. Does loop extrusion stall upon encountering those regions? Are established enhancer-promoter contacts transient or can they be stabilized by cohesin or other bridging proteins?

The driving task changes to a more supervisory role, reducing the task load and potentially leading to degraded performance. Similarly, the automated system may not (yet) function in all situations; it must intelligently assess the strengths and weaknesses of both driver and system and select the best control mode according to the context.\r\nSolution: MEDIATOR proposes an intelligent \u2018mediating\u2019 support system for road transport, enabling safe, real-time switching between human driver and system. It will constantly evaluate driving context, driver state and vehicle automation status, personalising its technology to the driver\u2019s general competence.\r\nApproach: MEDIATOR pursues a paradigm shift away from a view that prioritises either the driver or the automation, instead integrating the best of both.

In particular, I plan to study on Internet of Things (IoT) applications that allow LED-equipped everyday objects to interact with smartphone cameras on Visible Light Communication-based Augmented Reality (VbAR) application.\r\nAugmented Reality (AR) applications could be benefited for communication between LEDs and smartphone by enabling LED-equipped everyday objects to send information to smartphones. Light sources on everyday objects could blink at high speed to encode data, and smartphone camera could decode the received signal to extract data from everyday objects with AR application. For instance, a smartphone could display a Wi-Fi Router's SSID and password with the help of a nearby LED. Unfortunately, AR applications mostly suffer from the low data rates due to smartphone camera hardware and their limitations in terms of frames per second. In general, binary transmission is realized for LED-to-camera communication: each frame corresponds to one bit which results in very low data rate in the AR applications. On the one hand, Rolling Shutter method could overcome this limitation. Rolling Shutter is an image acquisition method which exists in the most of CMOS sensors. It can provide a higher data rate compared to the camera frame rate by reading data row-by-row instead of entire image at once. I aim to build a robust mathematical model and to implement a system prototype to demonstrate the coexistence of VbAR and rolling shutter on Android phone applications. This AR application provides transition dynamically between binary transmission and rolling shutter based on subset parameters such as LED size, camera parameters (sensor size, camera frame rate etc.), LED-to-camera distance and channel properties.

After the diagnosis system determines current problems of a railway system, a prognosis system is developed to predict the degradation pattern, remaining useful life (RUL), reliability, and risk of a railway system. To optimally design the maintenance plans according to the desired multi-objectives, maintenance optimisation and analysis are performed using the outputs from both diagnosis and prognosis systems. By integrating all three systems, we can transform monitoring data into actionable maintenance plan.

The demonstrator will be able to simulate turboprop airplanes, which have additional complexity due to their unique vibro-acoustic properties.\r\n\r\nWorldwide, approximately half of air travel is composed of short-range flights, for which turboprop aircraft are demonstrably better suited. They produce less CO2 emissions and are more efficient than jet aircraft. However, cabin noise and vibration is relatively higher in comparison to jet aircraft, lowering the perception of comfort and predisposing passengers to choose jet aircraft.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, a demonstrator is built in which passengers experience an aircraft interior in which various parameters influencing comfort can be varied to study improvements to the overall in-flight comfort. An initial comfort model is made based on the literature and then updated based on real flights. In these flights, participants complete questionnaires and wear a jacket, which will record data on sound, vibration, temperature, and pressure. The questionnaires contain questions on the perception of 1) physical ergonomics; 2) vibration; 3) acoustics; 4) spatial-psychological; 5) visual-light; 6) air quality; 7) smell; 8) temperature; and 9) temporal (time) requirements and related comfort sensation. In addition, some environmental conditions and psychophysiological reactions will be monitored. A protocol is made to study passengers in the demonstrator, aiming to solve the comfort issue.\r\n\r\nWhile applicable to all airplanes, the goal is to study noise and vibration of turboprops, which requires installing equipment like speakers and vibration actuators under seats.

The main questions proposed are \u201cWhat are the preferences of the citizens of the municipalities served by Meerlanden regarding re-use of municipal solid waste systems and how is this related to observed citizen characteristics?\u201d This will be analysed with a stated choice experiment, estimating a Multinomial Logit model and a Latent Class Model.

The objective of a blast furnace is the stable production of iron with a speci\ufb01ed composition, temperature and volume at the lowest possible cost. One of the most important factors in this regard is the bed porosity, which directly re\ufb02ects the permeability. Even a small change in porosity along the vertical axis of the bed has a drastic effect on the permeability, gas distribution, temperature and resulting chemical reactions throughout the bed. Hence, it can be deduced that a certain bed porosity distribution exists for which the gas-solid interactions result in optimal furnace ef\ufb01ciency. However, despite their existence for many decades, blast furnaces are still poorly understood in terms of the complex, interdependent processes occurring simultaneously during operation and, consequently, identifying the key process parameters which can be controlled and optimized is very challenging. The poor understanding of blast furnace processes requires an in-depth analysis of the system\u2019s behavior as a \ufb01rst step towards systematic optimization. Given the scale of the system and the diversity of materials and processes involved therein, the objective of this study is to develop a computational model which predicts the material behavior in the upper part of the furnace, i.e., during charging and descent in the lumpy zone. More speci\ufb01cally, granular phenomena such as layer build-up, segregation and abrasion \u2013 all resulting from interactions between the different raw materials in different \ufb02ow and stress regimes \u2013 will be studied in detail.

The rate of and preference for reactions depends strongly on availability of electron acceptors, pH, (catalytic) mineral deposits (Fe/Mn oxides), nutrients and microbial ecology (FeOB, AOB, MnOB, AsOB) - altogether determining the dominance of certain biological or chemical processes.\r\nIn this project a radical new approach is taken, moving away from O2-saturated aeration-filtration and making a major shift to process optimal, high flow filters (>30 m/h) with controlled oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). It is the aim of this interdisciplinary project to gain mechanistic insights into interacting biological and chemical redox reactions of the key groundwater constituents, Fe2+, Mn2+ and NH4+, and their transformation products. This knowledge will be translated into development of new, high capacity filter concepts, where the production of reusable Fe and Mn byproducts is stimulated. Specific emphasis will be given to the separation of ORP-controlled processes, where the technological focus will lie on the targeted dosing of electron acceptors prior to dedicated filters with ORP/pH meters supporting innovative soft sensors for process monitoring.", "date_created": "2021-01-13 16:35:02 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-01-13 18:54:23 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 55661, "grant_number": null, "title": "PhD-CEG-Improving analytical formulations evaluating URM walls in two-way bending", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Langzi Chang"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Langzi Chang"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2020-04-02 09:03:15 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-06-12 08:22:27 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 56351, "grant_number": null, "title": "Strategies towards integrated systems  for renewable fuel production", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Maartje Feenstra"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Maartje Feenstra"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2020-04-19 10:24:57 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-04-24 13:26:19 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 67198, "grant_number": null, "title": "PhD", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Cedric M\u00fcnger"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Cedric M\u00fcnger"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2020-11-27 08:39:30 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-27 08:39:30 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 62687, "grant_number": "724431", "title": "Covid tradeoffs international", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "ERC DMP", "id": 1547549517}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Caspar Chorus"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Caspar Chorus"}, "description": "We present participants in various countries, with a survey based choice experiment.

These investments are often made on the basis of Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). However, classical CBAs have difficulty incorporating citizens\u2019 ethical considerations concerning the procedural and distributive aspects of such decisions, considerations that clearly affect the social acceptance of decisions on sustainable energy policies.\r\n\r\nDutch practitioners now consider the use of Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE) instead of CBA as this approach has the potential to include citizens\u2019 ethical considerations in real-world economic policy analysis. In a PVE, citizens choose a portfolio of policies given one or more constraints (budget/sustainability target). Using these individual choices behavioural choice models are estimated that subsequently form the basis for an economic evaluation of different policies.\r\n\r\nThe present study is the third case study for the project: Participatory Value Evaluation: a new assessment model for promoting social acceptance of sustainable energy policies. This project has been approved by the ethics committee, but we want to submit each case study we will conduct in the project to the ethics committee as the case studies will be a bit different from the ones we planned when writing the proposal. \r\nThis project aims to contribute to the construction and use of ethically sensitive policy evaluation through the further development of PVEs. First, we investigate the extent to which PVE allows for the inclusion of citizens\u2019 ethical considerations through conducting PVEs in which we explicitly include morally salient features of sustainable energy policies. We then develop novel behavioural discrete choice models that measure the extent to which citizens are willing to forego personal benefits to foster ethical considerations. We use the resulting ethically informed utility functions for the economic assessment of sustainable energy policies. Second, we explore whether different applications of PVE can foster procedural justice by including the possibility of deliberation and co-design and study how these PVE applications impact citizens\u2019 social acceptance of sustainable energy policies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this third PVE we aim to support the municipality of Sudwest Fryslan (SWF) by including large numbers of citizens in strategic choices concerning the Regional Energy Strategy. \r\n\r\nWhat is new in the SWF case compared to previous PVE cases is that we are also inviting minors age 14-18 through the municipalities youth panel (\u2018jongerenpanel\u2019) to explore the relationship between age and preferences.

At present, great modelling efforts are undertaken in and outside the Netherlands to provide policy makers with ranges of estimates about the impacts of lifting various measures. However, Dutch policy makers do not only ground their decisions on predicted effects, but also on preferences of society. For instance, the Dutch Cabinet\u2019s decision to close the schools was based on perceived negative preferences of society towards this measure even though modelling exercises questioned the measure\u2019s impact. However, to our knowledge, systematic evidence of citizens\u2019 preferences regarding positive and negative effects of lifting measures is missing.

Key drivers of this revolution are layered materials like transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). The realisation of novel TMD-based electronic devices relies heavily on understanding the relation between structural and electrical properties at the nanoscale. Crucially, one-dimensional (1D) TMDs have been predicted to exhibit striking functionalities including metallic edge states, ferromagnetic behaviour, and mobilities that are not suppressed as compared to their 2D counterparts. Indeed, in the 1D nanoscale limit, the lateral edges of TMDs become dominant, opening novel opportunities to tune edge-induced electrical properties leading to i.e. enhanced charge carrier mobility. However, these predictions for novel phenomena in 1D TMDs lack experimental verification, due to the challenge in accessing the relevant information at the nanoscale. I propose to unravel the interplay between structural and electrical edge-induced properties by exploiting recent breakthroughs in electron microscopy (EM) allowing simultaneous unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution. I will focus on MoS2 nanoribbons, and use electron-energy loss spectroscopy to map the electronic properties at the nanometer-scale. Beyond the optimization of EM for 1D TMD characterization, I will investigate semiconducting-to-metal and ferromagnetic transitions by realising controllable edge structures.

Recently, it was discovered that organic coating loaded with lithium salts as the corrosion inhibitor presented effective corrosion inhibition on aluminum alloys. Although Visser et al. has conducted a series of researches to understand the inhibiting mechanism and the protection layer caused by lithium-leaching coating, the local electrochemical and chemical reaction and imaging which is essential to understand the progress of corrosion process and inhibiting mechanism still remains unknown. \r\n\r\nThe metal corrosion process is a typical interface electrochemical reaction. With the development of the corrosion process, anodic and cathodic sites appear on the metal surface, leading to the change of micro-chemical environment (such as pH, metal ions concentration, and spatial distribution). In addition, the addition of an inhibitor also will change the process of electrochemical and chemical reaction processes occurring on the anodic and cathodic zones. In general, the size of the anodic and cathodic regions is on the scale of micrometer and even nanometer. Therefore, it is difficult to measure and record the local interfacial chemical environment through conventional electrochemical and chemical characterization methods.\r\n\r\nElectrochemical noise measurement (ENM) has been proved a powerful tool to monitor the corrosion process during the last decades of years, and it has been used to identify and quantify localized corrosion, coating failure process, and screening of corrosion inhibitors. And ENM belongs to passive detection methods, which means it will not impose any interference on the corrosion process. However, ENM itself cannot provide interfacial electrochemical reaction directly, which make it difficult to determine the electrochemical and chemical reaction type. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is a kind of spatially resolved electrochemical technique, which could provide in-situ observation on local morphology, electrochemical imaging on electroactive sites and species distribution at the interface. As a scanning probe technique, SECM could only be operated in a relatively local area, which makes it difficult to observe and catch all the details of a corrosion process. Therefore, the combination of ENM and SECM is of vital importance to reveal the detailed corrosion process and how the inhibitor work continuously.\r\n\r\nThe scientific objective of this subject is to deeply realize the occurrence and evolution of the interfacial electrochemical reaction and certain chemical species distribution when a defect area is generated from lithium-leaching coating with the help of ENM and SECM techniques:\r\n\r\nAt the first stage, ENM and SECM will be used to measure the inhibition effect of lithium salts on aluminum alloy AA2024-T3 and scratched lithium-leaching coating separately;\r\n\r\nIn the second stage, the combination of ENM and SECM will be attempted on the study of electrochemical reaction over the aluminum alloys and the defecated lithium-leaching coating. Finally, software COMSOL will be used to attempt to simulate the electrochemical reaction and establish the corrosion model. The knowledge and understanding of this mechanism at the micrometer level and the application of combined electrochemical methods are essential for the development of corrosion monitoring technique and the improvement of this novel active protective coating.\r\n", "date_created": "2020-11-16 14:02:32 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-19 20:08:16 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 68103, "grant_number": null, "title": "PhD-CEG-Damage assessment on buildings and infrastructures", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Alfonso Prosperi"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Alfonso Prosperi"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2020-12-10 16:28:28 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-12-10 16:48:33 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 65580, "grant_number": null, "title": "Biocomposite: Safe-by-design for the circular economy", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Amalia Kallergi"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Amalia Kallergi"}, "description": "Aim:\r\nSafe-by-design (SbD) is a risk management approach that emphasizes risk minimization via appropriate design choices at early stages of technology development.

Several distinct microscopy techniques are available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of spatial resolution, field-of-view, molecular specificity, and invasiveness of sample preparation. The SMART BRAIN project seeks to advance the complementary measurement of neuronal tissue by different optical imaging technologies, and to develop the in silico integration of images collected by different methods by means of data-driven multimodal image fusion. This process will combine advantages from different source modalities into a single predictive imaging modality. Specifically, we will integrate 3-D multiphoton microscopy (MPM) data with 3-D light-sheet microscopy (LSM) measurements to deliver a single \u2018fused\u2019 predictive imaging modality that combines the molecular specificity of LSM with the non-invasive sample preparation of MPM. The fused modality will deliver LSM-grade information while avoiding LSM\u2019s invasive clearing procedure, in case tissue needs to be safeguarded for other analyses or for broad LSM-based molecular targeting post-MPM. Furthermore, we will explore fusion of MPM with super-resolution microscopy (STED), to predict 2-D multiphoton tissue observations at up to 10 times the diffraction limit. This project\u2019s unique multidisciplinary approach has the potential to provide an organizational description of brain tissue that surpasses what any single imaging technique can provide. The proposed approach is based on advanced machine learning algorithms originally developed for integration between 2-D imaging mass spectrometry and standard 2-D stained microscopy, with proof-of-concepts demonstrated in murine brain tissue. The SMART BRAIN project will extend these methods for fusion of multiphoton, light-sheet, and STED microscopy. The goal is to discover relationships between observations in the different modalities, to mathematically model them, and then to use them for prediction of morphological information at spatial resolutions beyond instrumental limitations or in tissue areas where not all data types are measured. Fusion of different datasets will be initiated on murine brain tissue, and subsequently extended to human brain samples. Specimens, provided by the neurosurgery partners in the consortium will be obtained from patients showing temporal lobe epilepsy and block of hippocampus and amygdala, as well as from autopsy of healthy subjects, yielding precious information on human brain morphology. The SMART BRAIN project will (i) provide a new multi-modal approach exceeding the state of the art in single-modality optical microscopy,(ii) support the HBP consortium with a previously unavailable fused data type and with unprecedented information on human brain morphology, and (iii) provide a novel methodology for combination with clinical imaging for advanced diagnostics.", "date_created": "2020-08-26 18:03:24 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-08-30 11:30:09 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 71719, "grant_number": null, "title": "3mE-PhD-Screening for extreme wave loading on marine structures", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "XYZ \u2013 test template (2021) \u2013 DO NOT USE", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Sanne van Essen"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Sanne van Essen"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2021-02-17 09:49:52 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-02-17 15:08:55 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 17}}, {"id": 53510, "grant_number": null, "title": "Questionnaire Items for Evaluating Human Interaction with An Artificial Social Agent", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Siska Fitrianie"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Siska Fitrianie"}, "description": "This study is the continuation of the research into creating a validated standardised questionnaire instrument for evaluating human interaction with an artificial social agent (e.g. animated conversational characters, robots and conversational (chat) programs).

Contamination of refurbished products describes feelings of unease or even disgust consumers feel because of the prior use of a product. In the context of consumer electronics, consumers fear that the product could be contaminated by traces of a prior user. The perceived contamination risk was shown to negatively predict the purchase intentions of refurbished headphones and blenders. \r\n\r\nIn this research, we want to explore which features of refurbished headphones are important to counteract the perceived contamination risk of refurbished headphones. \r\n\r\nOptimizing refurbished products to counteract contamination\r\nContamination can be triggered by the knowledge that the products have been used already. Wear-and tear can remind the consumer of the products prior life and therefore increase the fear of contamination. Wear-and tear can be visual, such as scratch marks or discoloration of the material, or can be functional, such as a decreased battery capacity of headphones. \r\nEven though refurbished products are thoroughly cleaned during the refurbishment process, this is often not communicated and leave the consumer with a fear of contamination.

Especially adsorption by activated carbon, oxidation by ozonation, biodegradation and the combination of these technologies have been investigated. However, the costs and the environmental impact of the combined use of ozonation \u2013 activated carbon adsorption are high caused by the use of activated carbon and the thermal reactivation of exhausted carbon. In addition, these technologies are not selective for the removal of CECs, as also background organic matter, present in high concentrations in treated wastewater, is removed and reduces the efficiency of CECs\u2019 removal. The objective of this project is to realize an innovative adsorption-oxidation process for CECs\u2019 removal from municipal wastewater based on the use of zeolites as adsorbent and the chemical regeneration of exhausted zeolites with ozone. As zeolites provide a framework of micro-pores which well matches CECs\u2019 molecules, adsorption of background organic matter, will potentially be excluded. Instead of thermal regeneration with a high energy use, low-energy chemical regeneration with ozone is applied.

Especially the understanding of late side effects is hampered by viable surrogate models and the response of tissue to radiation often needs to be studied in humans. Radiation-induced heart-disease (RIHD) is the late side effect of chest radiotherapy associated with the highest mortality, but remains poorly understood. In this project, we will develop novel imaging methods for non-invasive and quantitative mapping of cardiac electrical properties. This will 1) provide a sensitive biomarker for radiation-induced tissue damage that will help clinical radiotherapy spare radio-sensitive tissue and 2) further our basic understanding of radio-sensitivity in the heart.\r\n\r\nElectrical properties are sensitive to tissue irradiation in animal models and human skin, but the application to inner organs is hampered by a lack of suitable measurement techniques. Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging allows the non-invasive assessment of electrical properties by detecting the local interaction of tissue with the applied electromagnetic fields using MR Electrical Property Tomography (MREPT). However, previously proposed MREPT methods were designed for dedicated neuroimaging hardware that is used for both signal transmission and reception. In contrast, body imaging is commonly performed with separate hardware for transmission and reception and is additionally complicated by cardiac and respiratory motion. These constraints have prevented the application of MREPT to cardiac or other abdominal structures.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we derive a formula for MREPT with separate transmit and receive hardware from the equations for electromagnetism that enables noise-robust, closed-form calculation of electrical properties of the heart. We propose a novel MRI sequence to acquire all information necessary for 3D-MREPT in a single scan. The sequence will be designed to yield high robustness to cardiac and respiratory motion and will, therefore, enable the acquisition of the first MREPT maps of the heart.\r\n \r\nWe will validate the proposed method in phantom and in-vivo. We will acquire reference values in 35 healthy subjects and then evaluate sensitivity to radiation-induced tissue damage in 10 patients suffering from RIHD. This information will then be used to commence a clinical collaboration to investigate RIHD progression using MREPT as a biomarker for early cardiac tissue damage in follow-up screenings for patients undergoing radiotherapy.

Indeed, most of the existing literature treating the issues that go along with explainable AI can be considered decisively two-sided in addressing those separately. On the one hand, a strong focus is being put on purely epistemological issues and shortcomings, mostly regarding the opaque nature of machine learning algorithms which represents a limit to explanatory purposes. Within this debate, questions regarding the need for transparency in order to fulfil explanatory requirements are largely discussed and, among others, techniques are developed that, broadly, aim either at opening the black box or at providing ex post explanations. This debate is mostly technically driven and characterized by little philosophical input. The other side of the debate is characterized by a specific tendency to analyze the characteristics of the outcomes of algorithmic decisions and their normative implications. In this context, questions of justice, fairness, equality, discrimination and bias, responsibility attribution, accountability and privacy are treated, mostly without expanding in-depth on the investigation of the epistemological issues connected with those. Drawing on these observations, what seems to remain neglected in the current debate is the analysis of the pervasive interdependence between these two dimensions. In the face of these broad characteristics of the current state of the art, the overarching aim of my dissertation will be to bridge the gap and in doing so to renegotiate a stretch of the boarders between these two fields of enquiry, putting a particularly strong focus on the investigation of the intersection between epistemology and ethics in the context of explainable AI.

Energy community is a term used to represent initiatives based on the generation, distribution and consumption of renewable energy for all involved stakeholders. The commonality among all definitions of energy community is on three main aspects: locally located technology, stakeholders who interact with the technology, and its related institutions. \r\nIn the relatively mature literature of energy communities, there are two gaps; thermal energy applications and energy security.\r\nThermal energy applciaitons cover 75% of total non-transport energy consumption at the local. However, the literature and understanding about them is relatively limited and they have been neglected.   \r\nAlso, discussions around the energy security is focused mainly on the traditional notion of security of supply for energy communities. However, this is different from the energy security literature, which has been shifted from being mono-oriented towards security of supply, to more diverse discussions, e.g., with regards to acceptability and affordability in recent years. These changes in energy security literature have not yet reflected and translated into the energy community literature. \r\nThese knowledge gaps are problematic since they hamper the energy transition, especially in the Netherlands which heavily relying on natural gas.\r\nTherefore, in line with these limitations and also due to momentum that Dutch energy communities are gaining, it is necessary to explore these topics. We are building Agent-based models that are exploring these topics in the Netherlands. In this research there is a need for data from real world which would provide insights about realistic assumptions and also would help to validate the models.

Proper understanding of how human drivers will respond to AVs, and how AVs could interact with HDVs rather than responding to them is urgent but lacking. This lack of understanding may result in unsafe and inefficient traffic situations, as is explained in the proposal. AVs are not yet operating on public roads, and therefore empirical data on these interactions is not available. Furthermore, during the transition period, human drivers might adapt and change their behaviour as the percentage of AVs increases in traffic. The unique aspect and aim of the proposed project is its focus on understanding and modelling the interactions between human-driven and automated vehicles based on empirical data. We will develop and validate behavioural theories and models for the interactions between AVs and HDVs using a hybrid approach for data collection. We will underpin the behavioural theory using empirical data that we will collect from field tests using AVs. We will use advanced interactive driving simulators to study the interactions between AVs and HDVs. We will scale up the resulting interaction models in a dedicated traffic flow simulation platform to evaluate the implications of mixed traffic on traffic flow and safety. The results of this project will enable industrial partners in the proposal to develop more capable, safe and efficient control algorithms for AVs and road operators to develop a more suitable infrastructure for mixed traffic.\r\nTackling such a complex and multidisciplinary problem can only be done by close collaboration among vehicle manufacturers, road operators, contractors, academia and knowledge institutes.

Investigating the interaction between medical alarms and patients' physiological and psychological responses will further the understanding of the effects of alarms on evoking stress. Objective \u2013 We want to find out whether a correlation exists between the subjective experience of stress and physiological measurements of stress in participants exposed to medical alarms in a Virtual Intensive Care Environment. Methods - We will induce psychological stress in a controlled Virtual Reality (VR) experimental setup. Between-groups study design will be performed with three groups consisting of 10 young healthy adults each (N=30). Groups will undergo the same procedure but stress-induction will differ. Group B and C will be exposed to the same medical alarms, but Group C will also perform two stress-induction tasks; Group A will experience the ICU without alarms nor tasks. Data - Dataset will consist of Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings - collected by means of the Byteflies Kit; psychometric scores \u2013 by the administration of the S-Anxiety scale (STAI); and moment-to-moment rating of perceived stress - obtained by means of the Squegg smart ball.

Considering the call, especially for: (i) embedding up-to-date environmental-friendly energy technologies, and (ii) replacing obsolete or broken on-board systems by sophisticated automation systems and information, communication, and sensor technology.

The goal of this research therefore is to support the integrated ship and system design by enhancing the readiness of ships to undergo future modifications irrespective of the energy and automation transition paths.\r\n\r\nTo handle the automation transition the first pillar of READINESS will be the design of scalable, modular and fault tolerant control architectures with emphasis on autonomous navigation systems, considering the ship as a large network of interconnected subsystems. To handle the energy transition, the second research pillar will be the creation of optimisation algorithms for ship topology that make a trade-off between life cycle costs and the uncertain magnitude of ship modifications. The third pillar will be the robust design of routing methods for pipes, ducts and cables for handling efficiently any transition given the networked ship structure.\r\n\r\nThe impact of READINESS is expected to be multiplex.

However, 80% of this capacity is located in deep waters (> 60 m depth) where traditional fixed-bottom wind turbines cannot be installed in an economically feasible way [1]. Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) offer a good alternative as their floater manages to evade most of the cost increase with water depth characteristic of fixed bottom substructures. In spite of this promising feature, new challenges arise in the dynamics, structural integrity and control of FOWT. Since the substructure is now free to move and is subjected to hydro and aerodynamic loads, the rotor may undergo large motions which in turn can cause large variations in time of the inflow velocity along the blades. Depending on the magnitude of these variations, the rotor may leave the normal operating state to enter much more unsteady states such as the vortex-ring state characterized by the recirculation of the wake\u2019s vortices in the blades or even the propeller state where the wind velocity direction relative to the rotor is reversed [2]. These situations go far beyond the simple and practical assumptions like flow steadiness and attachment used to derive computationally efficient engineering models such as the blade element momentum theory (BEMT) [3]. The primary goals of this project are to understand the extra unsteady aerodynamic phenomena by means of high-fidelity simulations, specifically large-eddy simulations (LES), to relate these phenomena to the platform motion\u2019s characteristics and to assess their impact on power production and loads. In turn, the ultimate goal would be to use the findings to develop an improved unsteady BEMT model for FOWT and new control strategies to maximize power yield and decrease loading in the turbine.\r\n\tThe project is is part of the MSCA ITN project STEP4WIND (www.step4wind.eu) and is still at its initial stages. In this phase, NREL\u2019s OpenFAST code is used to identify potential limitations of BEMT. In this context, we first look at the effect of a prescribed motion and the frequency of stall occurrence for different degrees of freedom (DOF). The same studies will be replicated with SGRE internal aeroelastic code BHAWC and the results analyzed and compared in order to assess which is the best turbine model to use in the future LES simulations, between an actuator line representation of the blades or a fully resolved 3D model taking into account the accuracy and computational expense of the model.

Embedding the core language within the full language erases the gap between its specification and implementation, minimizing the amount of code we have to trust and enabling us to do a meta-theoretic study to increase our trust even further. An embedded core language is also useful in practice: we intend to explore its potential as the basis for meta-programming and proof exchange with other languages. Concretely, we will develop Agda Core, a small and trustworthy core language for Agda embedded within Agda itself. In the development of Agda Core we will pay special attention to extensibility, providing a solid foundation for formalizing Agda\u2019s various extensions.

There are 4 experimental PhD students ( 2 in Leiden and two in Delft) and I am the PhD student who studies theory. The research focuses on the phenomenon of Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS). In experiments that study the conducting behaviour of chiral molecules it was found that these molecules conduct electrons depending on their spin.\r\nMolecules can be chiral: this means that a molecule has a left - and right-handed version. The left handed version is the mirror image of the right-handed one and visa-versa, these mirror images are geometrically different from each other. We can think of an electron as a small sphere which can turn around its axis clockwise are anti-clockwise, and this rotation is identified as spin up and spin down respectively. A chiral molecule conducts one type of spin better than the other, depending on the chirality of the molecule.\r\nThe mechanism of spin selectivity in transport through chiral molecules is not yet understood.Several mechanisms for this selectivity have been proposed but none of these can explain the large spin polarization that is observed in experiments.

The use of sensors and telemetry may provide a cost-effective alternative to reduce or eliminate groundwater sampling and allow a faster response to new releases or changes in plume travel direction. Although hydrocarbon sensors have been available for some time, they are still relatively expensive, vulnerable and require frequent maintenance, and are therefore not a realistic alternative to groundwater sampling. Based on the hydrochemical processes that are triggered following a spill incident, it can be inferred that more general water quality parameters will also contain indirect information on hydrocarbon presence and level (e.g. pH, oxidation-reduction potential, electrical conductivity). These parameters can be measured using simple, cheap, and robust sensors. The concept of combining different sensors (sensor data fusion) for indicator parameters has been recently demonstrated for inorganic contaminants but not yet for hydrocarbons.The main objective of the proposal is to develop an innovative computational framework to monitor hydrocarbons in groundwater using sensor data fusion.

Over the last decades, GPR has become increasingly popular in hydrogeological applications because of the significant permittivity contrast between water and the other soil and rock components. Time-lapse GPR measurements have advantages in dynamic flow monitoring, because GPR signals can be enhanced by the change of saturations over time. Currently, fluid monitoring by GPR mainly focuses on shallow surface, but deep environments are more and more the recent subjects. Some studies have been designed to place radar sensors in a borehole to monitor fluids in the depth of hundreds of thousands of meters. We think borehole radar can be applied in both oil exploration and production fields. \r\n\r\nIn oil exploration, borehole radar logging can be used to detect the mud invasion, thereby evaluating formation permeability. In oil production, an array of borehole radars is expected to monitor the time evolution of water-oil displacement, whereby supports the production optimization.\r\n\r\nNumerical simulations are the primary method to investigate some key issues of GPR usage in oil reservoir environments. In oil well logging, a multiple-phase and multiple-component model is to be built up to simulate the time evolution of mud invasion, and an electromagnetic model is to be coupled to the mud invasion model to study radar responses to fluid invasion front. Sensitivity analysis will be implemented to study the effects of fluid and formation properties on radar reflections. A formulation, linking invasion depth with formation permeability, is to be derived to estimate the magnitude of formation permeability. \r\n\r\nIn oil production monitoring, a reservoir model is to be established to imitate a water-bottom driven production with a horizontal well, and then the electromagnetic model will be linked with it. The model simulates that an array of radars, installed along the casing, images the water front shape and monitors the dynamics of water-oil displacement in the production period. Some key issues, such as detection distance and resolution of radars will be analyzed, and sensitivity analysis will focus on the relationship between the effects of water-oil transition zone on radar signals. Finally, a certain production control schemes is to be implemented to estimate the economic prospect of radar utilization. \r\n", "date_created": "2020-07-15 12:04:12 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-07-15 13:46:13 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 13, "answered_questions": 14}}, {"id": 65021, "grant_number": null, "title": "Living Material Experiences: Facilitating Experiential Understanding of Living Materials in Material Driven Design", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Hazal Erturkan"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Hazal Erturkan"}, "description": "The need for decreasing the usage of non-renewable resources in design have brought attention to bio-design practice which integrates biological processes and living organism (e.g. plants and organism such as bacteria, algae and fungi) into design process to achieve sustainable material alternatives and novel material expressions in \u2019non-living\u2019 artefacts.

With the steady growth in air traffic, mitigating aviation\u2019s air pollution problem is one of the most pressing challenges in the aerospace sector. The goal of my Veni is to improve our understanding and assessment of aviation\u2019s air pollution societal impacts, through novel numerical methods.\r\n\r\nGiven the long timelines of aircraft production and operation, any technological or regulatory mitigation decisions we make now have multi-decadal effects. However, when assessing potential mitigation options, regulators and engineers disregard that these pertain to a future world, with different atmospheric chemical composition and meteorology. This assumption is made due to the high uncertainty in future atmospheric conditions, making it computationally impossible to analyse the entire space of possible impacts. Given the non-linearity of the atmospheric chemistry and physics that takes place between emission and air pollution formation, not accounting for future effects leads to misestimation of air pollution effects, and thus incorrect engineering design/regulatory choices. \r\n\r\nI will develop an aviation air pollution assessment tool that accounts for such future atmospheric effects, through the introduction of a novel numerical method (multi-complex step) to atmospheric-chemistry transport modeling. By transforming the numerical code to multi-complex variables and allowing the perturbations to be \u2018tracked\u2019 on the imaginary plane, this method will calculate higher-order sensitivities of the atmospheric responses to emissions, avoiding the cost and numerical noise of current approaches. \r\n\r\nResults of this Veni will quantify the present misestimation and provide a tool to include future atmospheric effects in aviation air pollution assessments, enabling more accurate technological and regulatory decision-making for mitigating aviation\u2019s air pollution impacts.\r\n", "date_created": "2020-11-17 11:03:07 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-12-20 20:31:38 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 60105, "grant_number": "016.Vidi.178.047", "title": "How should automated vehicles communicate with other road users?", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Joost de Winter"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Joost de Winter"}, "description": "In the coming decades, our roads will be populated with an unprecedented mixture of automated vehicles (AVs) and human road users (HRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and manually driven cars. \r\nA bottleneck is that current AVs do not communicate to HRUs, making AV-HRU encounters inefficient and potentially accident-prone as compared to HRUs who fluently move in traffic through mutual communication of their states and intentions. Because AVs have excellent sensor and computational abilities, the opportunity arises to develop AV-to-HRU communication that not only emulates but also surpasses the information content of HRU-to-HRU communication.\r\nMy research aims to devise novel AV-to-HRU communication methods. I will study the largely unexplored topic of how HRUs communicate with each other, and examine whether AVs\u2019 gestures should be human-like (anthropomorphic) or nonhuman (mechanistic), and implicit (embedded in vehicle motion) or explicit (visual/auditory signs). The effectiveness of the gestures will be assessed regarding whether HRUs are willing and able to use the AVs\u2019 gestures, and in terms of safety and efficiency of the AV-HRU encounters.\r\nFirst, I will perform naturalistic on-road studies and large online surveys to identify how HRUs apply implicit and explicit gestures, and to derive prototypical traffic scenarios where gesturing is important. Second, I will create two unique facilities (linked simulators and a test track setup with synchronized data logging) to determine the effectiveness of implicit anthropomorphic and implicit mechanistic gestures in staged HRU-HRU/AV encounters. Third, a closed-loop model that describes HRU-HRU/AV interactions will be developed and used to predict which explicit gestures HRUs need to receive from AVs. Finally, concepts of AVs that provide explicit gestures will be developed, tested, and demonstrated to industry on public roads. \r\nThrough this research line we will advance the knowledge of AV-HRU cooperation and contribute to the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic.\r\n", "date_created": "2020-06-30 09:30:59 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-06-30 09:31:24 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 68749, "grant_number": null, "title": "Test project", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1506827492}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "David Leibold"}, "data_contact": {"info": "David Leibold"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2020-12-29 16:32:06 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-01-13 13:55:11 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 17}}, {"id": 53708, "grant_number": null, "title": "Activity Recognition in Movement Patterns of Parkinson\u00b4s Disease Patients", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Melina Dekker"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Melina Dekker"}, "description": "The goal of this MSc thesis research is to develop a method that can be used for movement and posture detection using lower limb acceleration sensors.

Throughout evolution, it has found elegant ways to survive under -mostly extreme- mechanical conditions. Surprisingly, natural materials are composed of only a hard (e.g., minerals) and a soft (e.g., biopolymers) phase. These arrange together to form complex structural units (e.g., helices, bricks-and-mortars), which can vary or repeat at several hierarchical length-scales (e.g., from nm to mm), form functional gradients (e.g., to avoid high stresses in tendon-bone connection), and/or form anisotropic arrangements to handle physiological loads. The synergy between these design principles is responsible for the optimized mechanical properties of natural materials.\r\nNowadays, it is possible to reproduce bioinspired structures with multi-material 3D printing. Nevertheless, creating analytical and reproducible models of their mechanical properties is almost impossible given the complex and synergic nature of their principles. Therefore, the mechanistic role of each design paradigm has not been fully understood. This is important particularly when it is intended to design de-nuovo materials with similar properties of natural ones. The gap between bioinspired material design and desired mechanical properties can be addressed with the use of non-linear regression machine learning modelling. Therefore, the proposed idea aims to create a machine learning-based platform that maps composite mechanical property-spaces against several bioinspired micro-architecture principles and finds their optimal operation parameters.", "date_created": "2020-08-24 11:29:15 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-09-02 12:06:03 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 56365, "grant_number": null, "title": "Identifying contralateral contributions to the wrist joint dynamics during a cooperative bimanual task.", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Rosanne Pries"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Rosanne Pries"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2020-04-20 07:52:58 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-04-29 17:33:28 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 55362, "grant_number": null, "title": "DARE-TU: Developing Agriculture and Renewable Energy with the Turbine Pump", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Juan Carlo Intriago Zambrano"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Juan Carlo Intriago Zambrano"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2020-03-27 17:44:12 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-04 08:37:13 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 62408, "grant_number": null, "title": "Yasemin's Plan", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Horizon 2020 DMP", "id": 852527588}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Yasemin Turkyilmaz-van der Velden"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Yasemin Turkyilmaz-van der Velden"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2020-08-27 13:47:57 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-08-27 13:47:57 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 71, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 67194, "grant_number": null, "title": "Madeleine's Plan", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "XYZ \u2013 test template \u2013 DO NOT USE", "id": 975303870}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Madeleine de Smaele"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Madeleine de Smaele"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2020-11-27 07:44:45 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-27 07:45:26 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 36, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 59986, "grant_number": "nvt.", "title": "BK-PHD-The Q-factor and spatial design", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "sandra Van Assen"}, "data_contact": {"info": "sandra Van Assen"}, "description": "This PhD project addresses the phenomenon of current Dutch spatial quality advisory practices from a spatial design perspective.

A high steering gain is beneficial on a high steering demand curved road, while a low steering gain is beneficial for low steering demand straight road. In order to use this benefit in a continuous way matched to the individual driver, the applicability of an objective measure for steering behaviour is investigated. Candidate measure is human motor intermittency, which has, previously been correlated with the gain of the controlled element in human-machine interactions. A method that extracts human motor intermittency from human steering behaviour by analysis of the steering data in the time-frequency domain with the use of wavelets is used to analyse the steering data. Analysis of the steering data from drivers driving on different road types with different road types with a real-time intermittency extraction algorithm validates this correlation, and shows that this correlation extends to the relative gain of the controlled element to the controlled task. This model will be used to adapt the vehicle's steering gain, aka the relation of the steering wheel angle to the vehicle's lateral acceleration, of a four-wheel steering vehicle in real-time. In a computer simulated driving task, the gain adaptation strategy based on human motor intermittency should prove to increase/decrease driver acceptance ratings and performance. This framework of real-time human steering behaviour analysis and adaptation might also help other fields in man-machine automation such as steer-assist and shared control.

The process of atmospheric corrosion is rather complicated. Under certain atmospheric conditions, a thin aqueous film (or discrete droplets) that undergoes alternating wet/dry cycles could appear on metals. The wet/dry cycle is associated with condensation-evaporation processes of electrolyte thin film, with the former being controlled by the local environment (e.g. surrounding temperature, air-convection, relative humidity).</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>One of the biggest challenges for studying atmospheric corrosion comes from the fact that traditional corrosion assessment methods such as polarization test and EIS can only be applied when the electrolyte is continuous, allowing current to pass through. This project, however, deals with the circumstance where the appearance of non-continuous electrolyte is dominating. From an industrial point of view, accelerated corrosion test, where the aggressive electrolyte is sprayed onto metals following a wet-dry cycle and metals are weighed periodically for rate calculation, has long been the \u2018golden standards\u2019 for qualitatively assessing corrosion resistance of metals. Despite this, problems such as lacking a quantitative relationship between accelerated corrosion test and field exposure result remain unsolved. Besides, the corrosion mechanism when there is a group of droplets existing on the substrate remains unrevealed. The interaction between droplets and droplets remains unknown, despite the current progress in establishing a model for describing corrosion mechanism under a single droplet with certain curvature.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The idea is to assess metal corrosion rate by taking advantage of its change in electrical resistance (ER) when corrosion happens, such that corrosion rate can be evaluated in-situ. Meanwhile, a camera&amp;lens system will be adopted for continuously recording droplet profile on a metal substrate such that corrosion rate would be linked to electrolyte geometrical properties. ER signal processing would become one of the dominating contributors to corrosion rate resolution, so as for droplets image processing for droplet size and distribution resolution. With an investigation into the relationship between droplet information and corrosion rate, the knowledge of corrosion under a single droplet can be expanded to the case where a group of droplets exist.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Regarding droplet formation, salt spray is more common due to its simplicity in experimental apparatus and stability in ambient conditions. However, cons remain since the process is not very repeatable (which makes quantitative analysis into environmental conditions and droplet formation extremely hard). Droplet evolution itself can be pretty challenging to record. Additionally, the effect of ambient temperature on corrosion can only be roughly estimated since temperature adjustment lacks precision. An alternative approach to form electrolyte is physical-driven condensation, where electrolyte formation is initiated by the temperature difference between the metal substrate and ambient environment. Compared to salt spray, this process is more repeatable, and integration of camera &amp; lens system for droplet recording could be made more accessible. The major barrier would be to choose a proper method and construct an element for creating a subcooling between the substrate and the environment while keeping the fluctuation in environment conditions as small as possible. In other words, when an adjustment is applied to the environment according to requirements, the system should react swiftly while keeping other conditions as stable as possible (or have them adjusted as smooth as possible if they are dependent on each other). LABVIEW platform is therefore considered for precisely recording and changing all those environmental conditions such as substrate temperature, ambient temperature and ambient dew point temperature. The project will start from a simple case where both metal substrate properties and electrolyte content &amp; concentration is fixed. Then, the impact of electrolyte concentration will be studied. The effect of metal quantum properties will also be investigated if time allows.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>One of the outcomes should be an understanding of the numerical link between droplet profile and corrosion rate with respect to time. Some other understandings, such as relationships between environmental conditions and droplet profile and between environmental conditions and corrosion rate, can also be quite interesting. Machine learning method could be adopted for studying such relationships since multiple categories of variables/parameters are involved. The research outcomes would further help in understanding the corrosion mechanism and enhance the corrosion accelerated tests carried out in industries. The results are valuable for the development of corrosion prediction models, which could assist in, for instance, selecting proper materials for specific applications, such that both the performance and lifespan of the material can be promoted.</p>", "date_created": "2020-12-17 09:06:37 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-10-25 14:27:07 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 71333, "grant_number": null, "title": "Privacy concerns in explanations for tourism group recommendations", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "shabnam najafian"}, "data_contact": {"info": "shabnam najafian"}, "description": "We aim to design privacy-preserving explanations for tourism group recommendation apps.

Our ongoing work in Demak shows that coastal degradation can be reversed\r\nusing relatively cheap permeable brushwood dams that dampen waves, promote net mud sedimentation\r\nand foster return of mangroves. Our results also show that vertical poles can reduce wave energy as\r\neffectively as dams containing brushwood. In the Demak region, fishermen use vertical bamboo poles for\r\nmussel culture. This opens, in principle, a means for combining coastal restoration with provision of\r\nlivelihood, thus empowering local communities to steer coastal protection. We will investigate whether\r\ndual-purpose vertical bamboo pile arrays with mussel culture can make a viable business case for\r\nenvironmental and socio-economic revitalization of the affected area.\r\nProblems to be overcome range from optimization of pole arrays for coastal recovery, over\r\nunderstanding mussel response to environmental conditions, ecological consequences of the proposed\r\nrestoration schemes, to socio-economic embedding of the dual-purpose pole array strategy.

Upgrading the existing stock of social housing (SH) offers an opportunity to ease effects of inadequate housing through improvements; alleviate housing deficits; and promote sustainability. Upgrading efforts involve sensitive processes, and this research proposal uses Living Labs (LLs) as social innovations to communicate with SH agents like housing associations and municipals (United Kingdom (UK), Germany (DE)) and residents (Brazil (BR), the Netherlands (NL)) to create and validate solutions for upgrading programmes. Especially residential or user values are important to grasp to solve social and environmental issues. There is an urgent need to enhance communication between SH agents and users, and this proposal emphasizes the potential of new visualization approaches, such as gaming, Virtual Reality (VR), and Building Information Modelling (BIM) as means to bridge boundaries between stakeholders and users. Following Star and Griesemer (1989), these visualizations can be considered as Boundary Objects (BOs), and will be flexible enough to adapt to individual needs of involved stakeholders, yet specific enough to maintain a common meaning across all different stakeholders to support decision-making in participatory procedures. A transatlantic articulated nexus between research institutions in BR, DE, NL and UK orchestrates the LL experiences, and will contribute to idea generation and test decision-making efficiency. Each of these institutions investigates specific contexts and the combined nexus will increase understanding of how SH upgrading processes promote sustainability under different climatological conditions.

The present project investigates and evaluates how design can support motivation for a BC maintenance. \r\nIncentives, e.g. discounts, are proven motivators to initiate BC and form the core of the Dutch nationwide BENEFIT program that will form the basis of the project. We expect that incentives can support BC maintenance as well if they are personalized. We propose the four strategies of personalisation: 1) Adapt incentive\u2013type, -quantity, and \u2013moment to BC stage; 2) Introduce personal health feedback as motivator; 3) Personalise incentives to user\u2019s engagement profile; and 4) Change system-initiated incentives into user-initiated incentives. We will investigate theory, effect, and gamified eHealth design means of these strategies in two testbeds consisting of programs that are successful in BC initiation but not yet in BC maintenance.

However, in the aftermath of WWII, the Dutch architects Aldo and Hannie van Eyck already proposed a profound rethinking of the eurocentrism of his time. In their work, one can observe a hybrid of universalist and exoticist attitudes, looking for both continuity and renewal of the pre-war avant-garde and for critique on capitalist and nationalist ideologies of his time. This research aims to scrutinize the blending of non-western and modern art in the Van Eycks\u2019 designs in a holistic way where space, inhabitants, political ideas and ways of living merge to shape a multiculturalist notion of society and architecture. There have been earlier attempts to study Van Eyck\u2019s relation with the vernacular by Strauven (1998) and recently Jaschke (2011) and Rodr\u00edguez (2016), but they focused on form relations or lacked the full archival sources to tackle the issue. Recent research (2018) has uncovered an enormous amount of information that will be used to go beyond state-of-the-art. The multidisciplinary nature of the project is strong, since it will develop an innovative qualitative approach to the architect\u2019s oeuvre from his private house, an Anthropology of Architecture, using his full ethnographical art collection, books, travel pictures and conference slides as an entry to document and unpack the ways domesticity, global travels and art collecting intersect and sustain a non-universal view from which architecture was re-conceptualised. Proper measures will be taken to integrate the research into different areas of expertise.

Up to 20 male baseball pitchers, between 18 and 40 years old, will be asked to perform the following activities: throw 10-15 balls from the mound towards a large target on the home plate followed by 10-15 balls at small target. At another moment the pitchers will be asked to throw 10-15 balls at a small target followed by 10-15 balls at a large target. The pitchers will be asked to fill-out a questionnaire, containing questions about their age, size, personal records and preferences. The pitchers will be provided with compression shirt and shorts which includes sensors containing IMU\u2019s. These will measure the peak rotational velocities of the pelvis and the trunk and the timing between them. A radar gun will be used to measure the ball velocity, this is needed to ensure that the pitchers maintain a high pitching performance and that their ball velocity does not come at the expense of accuracy, to keep the pitching realistic.

Assisted living in home environments is considered as primary scenario, but the approaches and findings of our project can influence the wider radar sensing field, including outdoor surveillance scenarios and other classes of targets (e.g. automotive, ships, drones and UAVs, larger aircraft).\r\nThe ambition is to design and validate \u201cradar-aware\u201d approaches that can account for the specific nature of continuous and correlated sequences of radar data, and incorporate domain-specific and contextual knowledge into the core of the classification networks proposed. Rather than simply adapting networks designed for other data such as audio, natural language, or video processing, this requires fundamental research to understand, model, and capture the intrinsic kinematic information encoded in the sequence of radar data, which is strongly related to the movements of people observed.\r\nTo enable interpreting the radar data as a continuous sequence of temporal information, rather than artificial \u201csnapshots images\u201d that cut arbitrarily the sequence of data, the development of new architectures based on temporal-convolutional and bi-directional recurrent networks is investigated. This will help us analyse continuous sequences of diverse human activities from body macro-movements to micro-movements of gestures, where the transitions between them can happen at random times and each activity has non-predefined duration. This is a step forward compared to the state of the art in radar, where human motions have been typically observed as separate, distinct movements, classified by standard convolutional networks.\r\nA further challenge is to incorporate kinematic and contextual information into the proposed networks through the usage of memory and attention mechanisms. The modelling and addition of this extra kinematic knowledge will help make the decision process of the networks more explainable, thus reducing the \u201cblack-box perception\u201d of the approach that may hinder its usage. Furthermore, this will avoid resorting to very deep networks in \u201cend-to-end learning\u201d frameworks, for which it is unfeasible to obtain sufficient experimental radar data for training.\r\nThe project will combine theoretical modelling work in developing innovative classification algorithms specifically suitable for sequential radar data, and experimental work to validate the approach with mm-wave radar.

We study the interplay between these two macroscopic quantum phenomena to explore an untamed scientific corner experimentally. Investigations on superconducting Casimir experiments can provide a solution to a century-old debate on the nature of electrons, and may give a new understanding of nanoscale gravity and the underlying mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Stably positioning of two parallel large objects nanometers apart in cryogenic temperatures and measuring the forces between them, is very chanllenging.

These marine systems are relevant to all themes within the Blue Route, with specific emphasis on Water as a Blue Pathway. Such new complex marine systems have sizes and lifetime operability and reliability requirements unlike anything we have previously engineered. Accounting for the extreme loading situations these structures will face during their lifetime is a particularly challenging design problem. As engineers seek innovative solutions to further tap the potential of the maritime sector, they will need advanced design and analysis methods to understand whether these systems are sufficiently reliable.\r\n\r\nTo address this challenge, this project develops three unique aspects: 1) a new multi-fidelity design framework constructed specifically to account for extreme wave loading events these marine systems will face throughout their lifetime, 2) new reduced-order physics-based wave loading models to realistically describe relevant lifetime loading scenarios, and 3) efficient methods to identify sea states expected to lead to extreme loading of these novel systems. This new design framework targets the early stages of the design process where many of the reliability performance characteristics are set (via requirements) and locked-in (via initial design choices). Addressing these challenges early eliminates surprises later in the design process which can lead to cost run-ups, schedule delays, missed performance targets, an increased risk profile, or substantial re-work to address structural or dynamic challenges. Combining new reduced-order loading models early in the design process with directed excitation scenarios relevant for extreme responses via the new design framework will provide designers improved foresight on the risk-related implications of design decisions for new, novel, and complex sea-going structures.", "date_created": "2020-02-12 13:13:30 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-03-06 09:31:07 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 47270, "grant_number": null, "title": "Twitter Analysis via TCAT on AI Discourse Networks", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Tom Coggins"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Tom Coggins"}, "description": "For this project, I will investigate the online discourse and social networks associated with several AI-powered technical artefacts by capturing and analysing Twitter data.

This approach is characterised by a high level of participation of the inhabitants, allowing them to produce their housing with the help of organizations and other professionals. Currently, in Chile, as well as in Europe, we recognize the interest in developing collaborative initiatives and projects of \"self-management\" (managed by the users)  and \"self-building\" (built by the users). Presently, the Chilean housing system faces problems, such as lack of housing affordability caused by social inequality of housing distribution, lack of quality, social exclusion, little mutual support and lack of participation and empowerment of the residents, which the institutional system of housing provision has failed to solve . Broadly, the majority of housing does not respond to the basic needs of its inhabitants. The situation has generated the urgency to create new alternatives, methods and housing strategies, which incorporate the participation of the inhabitants in its development, which has values that have been neglected in public policies and regulations. Given this urgency, the implementation of \"collaborative housing\" initiatives might have potential to improve the situation and may have some advantages compared to the more traditional ways of housing provision in Chile (individual ownership and rent). Therefore, the research seeks to analyse whether it is possible to implement European forms of \"collaborative housing\", that emerged as a solution to similar housing problems and to diminish the lack of existing housing models in Chile. To critically assess the possibilities of collaborative housing to contribute solving these challenges, this research proposes an analytical framework to study  the historical precedents of what could be called CH in Chile, an analysis of collaborative housing projects in Europe, the analysis of the feasibility of its implementation and finally the design a new method to develop collaborative housing in Chile.", "date_created": "2019-11-18 17:06:27 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-06-26 10:30:30 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 14}}, {"id": 57999, "grant_number": null, "title": "Effect vliegbelasting op milieubewustzijn", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Machteld Rouw\u00e9"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Machteld Rouw\u00e9"}, "description": "Het doel van dit onderzoek is om het effect van vliegbelasting op milieubewustzijn van Nederlandse toeristen te onderzoeken.

The main aim of the research is to understand the potential behavioural adaptation in vehicle control of the human drivers when they interact with fully self-driving driverless vehicles in mixed traffic situation. This research involves the measurement of car following behaviour and overtaking behaviour along with subjective and objective stress of the driver during their interaction with a self-driving vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe expected behavioural adaptation is intended to be captured using a controlled field test along with a questionnaire. Thus, in the controlled field test, participants will be asked to drive normally in a designated route where they will interact with our data collection test Vehicle. The participants will be asked to wear a small finger-based heart rate sensor for the physio-psychological measurement of stress. As it is impossible to have a fully self-driving vehicle, the \u201cWizard-of-Oz\u201d technique will be used in which the body of the driver will be hidden in a special seat suit costume that can still allow the driver to completely control the vehicle and as well observe the environment. Thus, the test vehicle will actually be manually driven by a professional driver. After the driving test, the participants will be asked to fill in a questionnaire which relates to their perceived experience and stress during the experiment.\r\n\r\nA total of 30-40 participants (representing different gender and background) who commute frequently by their car and have a valid driving licence will be selected.

However, despite developments in electrocatalysts and system design, none of the electrochemical methods has grown to a market-leading technology in the energy or water sector.

Following from these risks, some governmental organisations are hesitant to use machine learning, leading to missed chances at improving service towards citizens. Public supervisory agencies serve an important role in mitigating the risks of machine learning by holding governmental agencies accountable for their use,  or misuse,  of machine learning applications. Their  supervision  can  in  turn  increase  trust  in  governmental  use  of  machine  learning,  leading  to  a decrease in underuse for organisations previously hesitant towards using machine learning.

The size of genomes varies by three orders of magnitude across organisms. Yet, all species face the same fundamental challenge: to compact their genomes into the confined volume of a cell. This is a daunting task, requiring human cells to compact about 1 m of DNA to 10 \u00b5m sized nucleus (factor of 100\u2019000) and bacteria to compact about 1.4 mm of DNA to their bodies which are just about 1 \u00b5m in diameter (factor of 1\u2019000). Over the last decade, thanks to development of enabling techniques for chromosome scale studies of DNA conformation, polymer physics computational models and single molecule studies, our understanding of genome architecture in time and space has progressed rapidly. Yet, the descriptions are largely phenomenological and the understanding of contribution that diverse phenomena have on global genome architecture, how they act together and how they contribute to gene regulation is incomplete. Many puzzling questions remain, three of which are guiding this proposal 'Are there physical principles that organize genomes across species and what are they?', 'How do cells achieve dynamic DNA accessibility despite the need for high compaction?' and 'What is the mechanistic interplay between spatiotemporal organization of genomes and the regulation of gene expression?'. In this project we develop a novel assay for the bottom-up dissection of genome organization mechanisms, focusing on structuring and transcription associated proteins. We describe the effect of several prominent nucleoid associated proteins on the mesoscale architecture of bacterial genomes. Further, we establish causality between transcription factor recruitment, DNA locus repositioning and transcription regulation in a minimal system.

The concept of spatial heteronomy captures the apparent anomaly of multicultural historic urban cities based on social parameters such as ethnicity, religion, shared histories, conflicts and boundaries, economics, evolving cultures, and environments. Multicultural societies not only embody shared values and memories but also common institutions and practices and are governed by the phenomenon of modernization. This movement of modernization often connotes building a uniform identity or standardization by the idea of a nation-state or institution and in many cases, this generates otherness leading to exclusivist attitudes and spatial fragmentation. This process injects alterity, and appropriation through spatial practices. Such trends and patterns of change embedded in the processes of economic, social, and political transformation profoundly influence the spatial planning, concepts, and methods of management of change. Planning and heritage management is central to development, however, the cognizance of this socio-spatial character of historic urban areas play a crucial role in the planning of historic urban areas. \r\nThis Ph.D. research aims to highlight and develop methods to represent the liminal spaces within the urban context of Tel Aviv-Yafo in Israel, a dynamic yet contradicting urban reality, owing to historical and political events. Its historic counterpart the old port town of Jaffa and is environs, propagating social interaction, existed through a complex patchwork of interwoven and evolving lands uses. Although the theory of integrating socio-spatial modalities in the process of managing change, development, and planning is supported in literature, it is often underrepresented in practice. The definitions of culture are segregated from their relation to geographies and seek to set boundaries and contours establishing an ideal set of values generating spatial as well as cognitive boundaries. The endorsement of the New Urban Agenda (UN Habitat, 2017) accentuates the need for sustainable leveraging of natural and cultural heritage, tangible and intangible, in cities and human settlements through integrated urban and territorial policies. This theory is built on the UNESCO Recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape (UNESCO, 2011) stressing a landscape approach to ensure integration of cultural heritage policies and planning concerns for sustainable and inclusive methods for urban heritage management. This research stems from the need for representation and documentation for the integration of socio-spatial aspects in multicultural societies having contested heritage and societal values. The main objective of the research is to identify attributes of socio-spatial planning systems within the frameworks of the Recommendations of the Historic Urban Landscape (UNESCO-HUL, 2011), the New Urban Agenda (UN-HABITAT-III, 2017), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN-SDG, 2015), Culture: Urban future (UNESCO, 2016);  New Urban Agenda (UN Habitat, 2016), Culture 2030 indicators (UNESCO, 2019) and integration by use of datascaping. \r\nThe digital turn of the 21st Century C.E. has witnessed emerging concepts of big data, smart cities, urban science, and data-driven cities that are merging with innovation in technology and reshaping the urban environment and processes. Innovative processes have the potential to augment the capacity of data analytics through integration with the use of datascape methods. These digital representations can provide an alternative to mainstream spatial representations. This can be achieved by re-visioning urban heritage management and designing data collection, analysis, and visualization of attributes to bridge the gap between policymakers and citizens and breaking silos of information within institutions. This exercise of mapping and visualization through the use of digital tools and data analytics will be used to assess the developed method for its relevance towards new approaches for urban heritage management professionals and contribute to the ontologies and discourse of urban heritage management, cultural landscape characterization, and sustainability and resilience of cities and societies.  \r\n", "date_created": "2020-05-11 15:25:47 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-10-14 17:00:52 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 71, "answered_questions": 9}}, {"id": 67139, "grant_number": null, "title": "test3", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1506827492}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Esther Plomp"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Esther Plomp"}, "description": null, "date_created": "2020-11-26 12:58:45 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-26 12:58:45 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 0}}, {"id": 69155, "grant_number": null, "title": "3D data peer review framework (DCC)", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Yan Wang"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Yan Wang"}, "description": "The 3D Data group have developed a framework for peer review of 3D data which we would like to develop a platform for this framework with the support of the Digital Competence Centre (DCC).

Two system dynamics are selected to examine transfer of training effects, resulting in one \u201ceasy\u201d helicopter configuration (requiring higher pilot compensation to accomplish the task) and in one \u201chard\u201d helicopter configuration (requiring lower pilot compensation to accomplish the task). Invited pilots will be divided in two groups. Each group will undergo 3 experimental phases:\r\n1.\tTraining phase: perform the straight-in autorotation maneuver with either the hard/easy helicopter dynamics.\r\n2.\tTransfer phase: perform the straight-in autorotation maneuver with the other helicopter configuration.\r\n3.\tBack-transfer phase: perform the straight-in autorotation maneuver with the initial hard/easy helicopter configuration.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this experiment is to determine whether a certain helicopter dynamics may lead to the development of a more robust control behavior that can be easily adapted to different system dynamics and to identify possibly risky cross-training scenarios.", "date_created": "2021-01-19 21:55:14 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-01-22 11:47:52 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 69520, "grant_number": null, "title": "Amplitude Dynamics of Motion Sickness", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Tugrul Irmak"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Tugrul Irmak"}, "description": "Automated vehicles are a major technological milestone that are hoped to provide respite from driving and allow engagement in other activities. One concern that arises from this however is motion sickness. It is estimated that 60-70% of people have experience symptoms of motion sickness in current vehicles. This, if not reduced, will lower the benefits automation is purported to provide. Therefore we need to develop control strategies that will minimise the incidence of motion sickness. To do so, a predictive model of motion sickness is needed. \r\n\r\nMathematical models have been formulated by studying frequency and time response but, the effect of motion amplitude has not been studied in detail. A complex relationship of motion sickness with amplitude exists. But this has not been quantified reliably. Varying amplitude in experiments can greatly help in understanding the relationship and help in developing ways to control motion sickness. The research question for the experiment thus is,\r\n\u201cWhat are the effects of varying amplitude on the time course of motion sickness?\u201d\r\n\r\nA within subject experiment will be used with participants undergoing the four experimental conditions. Participants will be screened based on their motion sickness susceptibility and proper functioning of vestibular system. During the experiment, they will be seated in the SIMONA Research Simulator. They will then be subject to a pure sinusoidal oscillation of 0.4 Hz with a fore-aft acceleration at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 ms/2. Each condition will be experienced on separate sessions, separated by at least 1 week to prevent habituation. Each session will consist of a 60 minute first motion trial, which will be followed by a rest of maximum 15 minutes, followed by a 30 minute second motion trial at the same amplitude as the first. Participants will be asked to rate their motion sickness level on a 11 point motion sickness scale (MISC scale). A given motion trial will be terminated when participant reaches a sickness level of 7 which is moderate nausea, similar to a level that might be experienced in stop and go traffic. In order to measure objective physiological correlates to motion sickness, galvanic skin resistance will also be recorded. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "date_created": "2021-01-14 10:46:46 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-01-20 09:22:24 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 67229, "grant_number": null, "title": "MSc thesis Tim Nederveen", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Tim Nederveen"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Tim Nederveen"}, "description": "For my master thesis, I'm working as an intern at Exact in Delft.

Road authorities and pavement industry face numerous challenges related to the need for increasing recycling rates (circular economy), the low asphalt quality and high performance variability, the demand for rejuvenators and performance-enhancers, and climate change. Furthermore, emerging binding materials (recycled bitumen, bio-binders, polyurethane, epoxy, rubber-modified binders) are being considered as sustainable replacements of traditional petroleum-based binders to mitigate pollution and depletion of fossil fuels.\r\nHowever, there is lack of technology for efficient and reliable prediction of long-term material performance under multiple, complex and interacting environmental conditions considering the changing material characteristics due to variable bitumen quality, and inclusion of recycled materials and non-traditional binders. To this end, I aim to uncover, model and optimize the relationship between chemistry, rheology and mechanical response of paving materials (and related engineering systems) considering the physico-chemical degradation processes.\r\nI propose a multiscale multiphysics approach that combines both experimental and numerical methods to model, predict and optimize long-term material performance using fundamental-based chemo-mechanical relationships (scale-independent properties), advanced material modelling (viscoelasticity, damage, plasticity, upscaling techniques) and coupled environmental degradation kinetics (moisture, oxygen, temperature).\r\nAn improved understanding of the link between material compositional characteristics and performance (and its temporal evolution due to environmental factors) and the tools to model it will enable an a-priori design approach wherein material systems can be engineered via chemical interventions to develop circular, durable, climate-resilient, and high-performance paving materials.

It is for this reason that the field has attracted so much interest from academic and private industry alike. However, everything has a cost: although the promises from quantum computing appear to be great, it has currently not been definitively demonstrated that a quantum computer can offer the large speedups conjectured by academic work. One of the major obstacles towards irrefutably demonstrating so-called \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d involves the inherent difficulties of building a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer. In order to do so, one must be able to efficiently encode logical quantum data into several physical qubits at once; this concept is known as quantum-error correction (QEC), and is an essential facet of building a large-scale quantum computer. By the end of this thesis, one of the main goals is to propose and implement a machine-learning based algorithm that can adapt every portion of the QEC process to changes in noise statistics such that the unique symmetry and fault-tolerance properties of a QEC code are preserved, and thresholds are optimal. Addtionally, a secondary goal of this thesis will be to understand and develop methods in order to realize the so-called holographic QEC codes in NISQ-era quantum processors.

In the Groningen field area, surface\r\nsubsidence is an important issue because the field is close to or below sea level. Furthermore, height and stability of nearby dykes are important to reduce the risk of flooding (van Thienen-Visser and Breunese, 2015). Apart from induced earthquakes, the growing of both energy consumption and human population, pushes the boundaries of geo-engineering. Various type of cyclic and dynamic loadings are also encountered during geo-engineering design, construction and operation, for example:\r\npile installation into soil layers, wave/wind acting on offshore structures, transportation loading on road foundation. The\r\nshallow layers in the top 20-30m below the ground surface account for about 80% of the site amplification and almost all of the permanent displacements. Research is urgently needed to improve understanding of the behavior of the soft top layers during cyclic and dynamic loadings. Currently, questions relating to the influence of soft deposits on earthquake progression and consequent soil response cannot be adequately answered. In addition, the short duration and repetitive nature of induced earthquakes have an impact on soil layers that has not been implemented in todays\u2019 models.The SOFTTOP project aims to expand the current analysis toolkit with proper constitutive models for sand and organic soils, the dominant soil types in the deltaic shallow subsurface, quantified within a framework for multi-scale heterogeneity.

The idea to mount a robotic arm onto mobile base results from the simple desire to increase a manipulator\u2019s workspace and thus allow a wider range of possible tasks. Despite advances in both separate fields, the full potential of the combined system is yet to be exploited. Firstly, the partly historic reason to split the motion planning of these systems into locomotion and arm motion leads to high operational times. Secondly, the classical definition of the motion planning problem prevents human-like movement for mobile manipulators. Specifically, the need to express goal position and initial position in the robot\u2019s configuration space during global planning restricts local planning methods, especially if the dimension of the configuration space is higher than the dimension of the motion planning goal. Lastly, safety is of particular importance in human-shared environments. Approaches for mobile manipulation follow the principal safety by collision avoidance which was mainly developed in the context of mobile robots. While this principle is justified for fast-moving robots such as autonomous cars, it is arguably too conservative for mobile manipulation. Moreover, as those robots are equipped with manipulation skills, interaction with humans often requires intentional collisions. To tackle this, compliant control schemes have gained popularity in manipulation applications. This Ph.D. focuses on unified, whole-body motion planning approaches to mobile manipulation that do not rely on configuration space representations of goals while providing safety through a combination of collision avoidance and compliance.", "date_created": "2020-05-18 12:37:14 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-02-15 16:11:10 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 71691, "grant_number": "895384", "title": "Multiculturalism in the work of Aldo and Hannie van Eyck: rethinking universalist notions in architecture", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Alejandro Campos Uribe"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Alejandro Campos Uribe"}, "description": "Today, we live immersed in a new globalized universalism, an increasingly homogeneous planet where architecture remains dominated by mass media, hindering renewal.

Precise control of the properties of these nanoscale materials is key. In recent years, a new class of quantum materials has been on the forefront of condensed matter research: topological insulators (TIs). TIs hold significant potential for nano-electronic applications, as they do not conduct electrons in the bulk, but rather exhibit low-resistivity, protected, conducting states in the boundaries. These high-mobility surface states can be exploited for applications such as energy-efficient devices with low Joule heating, but also act as promising candidates for hosting qubits in quantum computers. However, despite the promising applications and the already impressive progress, there is still a lot to be discovered regarding the relations between crystal structures, chemical compositions and functionalities in these quantum materials. One aspect of particular relevant interest is quantifying the role of strain in these materials.

Activated carbon adsorption is one of the effectively and extensively used technologies to remove organic contaminants. When considering the adsorption of OMPs, it is important to include the influence of natural organic matter (NOM), the presence of which can adversely impact adsorbent capacities for OMPs and the corresponding kinetics. However, the process design and operation for adsorption in waterworks still lack corresponding scientific support when the natural organic matter characteristics are highly heterogeneous and some pretreatments (like ozonation) exist before adsorption. The present study aims at finding the key NOM fraction affecting adsorption interference towards OMPs. Some model compounds are introduced to simulate NOM and help clarify key molecular properties for adsorption competition. Then detailed NOM characteristics in raw water and pre-ozonated water are analyzed with high resolution mass spectrum to further visualize the formula of competing NOM. Finally, the fate of adsorbed NOM in activated carbon filters is further analyzed to decode the mechanism of biological activated carbon to remove NOM and OMPs.\r\nPublication goals: 4 peer review research articles in international scientific journals.", "date_created": "2020-05-29 07:53:45 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-07-15 10:10:54 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 53836, "grant_number": null, "title": "Solo diners and the use of ICT devices as part of the eating experience", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1753695087}, "funder": {"name": "Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)"}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Mailin Lemke"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Mailin Lemke"}, "description": "Eating alone has become a popular form of eating due to social changes including flexible work hours, individualized eating more, more people living alone, an altered attitude towards eating out, a decline of associated social stigma and an increase of snacking instead of the traditional consumption of the main meal among family or friends.

The most challenging task in this pursuit is to reduce the fuel consumption of an aircraft which necessitated the designers to explore new avenues in the currently available design space. Apart from the improvement in propulsion systems, the reduction in structural weight is another key player in economizing the fuel consumption but it also results in lightweight highly flexible constructions that are more prone to dynamic instabilities. A possible means of reducing the structural weight and controlling the dynamic response of an aircraft is by passively alleviating its wing aeroelastic loads including flight maneuver and gust loads via multidisciplinary optimization. These loads are highly dependent on the wing material stiffness, its shape and the inner structural layout. The shape of the wing determines its performance at 1g flight condition. The inner structural layout of the wing is characterized by the number, location and orientation of wingbox elements (spars, ribs and stiffeners) and their tailoring can generate novel design configurations for future generation aircraft. A significant amount of work has been done on stiffness tailoring of the wing material. Hence this project aims to explore the wing design space for passive loads alleviation by tailoring the wingbox layout and carrying out simultaneous performance optimization through shape optimization. The mutual influence of material stiffness tailoring and wingbox layout tailoring will be investigated and simultaneous shape and stiffness optimization will be performed. Various high fidelity aerostructure optimization simulations will be performed and the wing will be optimized for maneuver and gust loads under aeroelastic constraints.", "date_created": "2020-06-11 19:22:02 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-11-13 13:00:00 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 11}}, {"id": 48666, "grant_number": null, "title": "PhD-Thesis_RWJOverwater", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Ramon Overwater"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Ramon Overwater"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2019-11-22 10:09:36 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2019-11-22 10:21:01 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 14, "answered_questions": 9}}, {"id": 38183, "grant_number": null, "title": "*test*", "test_plan": true, "template": {"title": "Voor projecten die zijn gehonoreerd v\u00f3\u00f3r 1 januari 2020 -

Indeed, there are several aspects to consider, such as seat dimensions, materials (including foams, texture, the metal structure, springs, and so on), the space around the seat, the environment, the adjustability, etc. The seat pan design could be mainly influenced by two factors: pressure distribution and seat contour. Literature studies showed that having the ideal pressure distribution on a seat designed for driver or passenger could lead to more comfort on a more than 2 hours\u2019 drive than self-chosen seat adjustments. Moreover, there are indications that a seat contour resulting in a large contact area is correlated to more comfort. One way to achieve this would be to use soft foam in the cushion to let the foam follow the entire contour shape of the user's buttocks, risking to handle large volumes of foams. Another way would be to use a shaped contour shell derived from the human body and handle a less amount of foams to fit a large considered population, including the P5 females and P95 males. However, these literature studies focused on static postures when instead people prefer to move freely on the seat, also performing small movements in the same position.

In this research proposal it will be assumed that longitudinal data  take value in a nonlinear space. We aim to develop new statistical methods for such  data that allow for uncertainty quantification of estimates.\r\n\r\nTo define a statistical model, I will consider the recently proposed idea of defining probability measures on manifolds  as transition densities of stochastic processes that solve a stochastic differential equation (SDE). I will focus on developing Bayesian statistical methods. This challenging problem has not been addressed before and  lies at the interface of probability theory, (computational) statistics and geometry. On a more technical level, a key problem consists of intractability of the likelihood of discretely observed  SDEs. Earlier research on resolving this issue in the vector space setting is expected to provide insights to the much more involved corresponding problem on nonlinear spaces.\r\n", "date_created": "2020-04-01 12:14:38 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2020-04-23 19:18:10 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 66744, "grant_number": null, "title": "Satellite subsidence and sea-level data assimilation for mean high-water line assessment in the Bangkok area ", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "Data Management Plan NWO (September 2020)", "id": 1753695087}, "funder": {"name": "Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)"}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Femke Vossepoel"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Femke Vossepoel"}, "description": "", "date_created": "2020-11-20 09:24:33 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-01-07 08:26:51 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 18, "answered_questions": 18}}, {"id": 69512, "grant_number": "Project number 15339", "title": "CEG_PhD_Leak-detection_bramstegeman", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Bram Stegeman"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Bram Stegeman"}, "description": "Due to ageing of our underground wastewater infrastructure, leakage of sewers and pressure mains and subsequent infiltration or exfiltration is becoming an increasingly important issue.

Thus, there is benefit in relieving human drivers of control over their vehicles in favor of automation. However, removing human drivers from the equation means that communication between them and other road users will be lost, along with the added layer of road safety it brings. Therefore, in the interest of safe transportation, automated vehicles should be able to communicate like human drivers, if not better. This poses a particular challenge in the case of non-verbal communication, which often takes the form of subtle cues such as eye contact between drivers and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians. Hence, it is useful to study and understand how humans make eye contact in traffic, and how it affects road safety. Better yet, if eye contact in traffic could be reliably detected, then perhaps it could be used improve road safety or even be substituted by some artefact in the case of automated vehicles. As a human factors researcher, this is a topic of great interest that deserves special attention via a PhD project.\r\nIn scientific literature, the role and detection of eye contact in the traffic setting has not been covered in as much depth as in the social setting. Eye contact between road users has been discussed in several papers, but the majority of them neither measure the effects of its absence/presence on road users\u2019 behavior nor talk specifically about what it means to road users. There is also still no consensus on whether eye contact is important for road crossing or not. Further, many past studies, unfortunately, can only assume eye contact\u2019s occurrence in their experiments due to the inconclusive nature of the recording techniques used.\r\nSo far, eye tracking is the only method that can objectively determine if eye contact between two parties has been established, and currently, there are only a few studies that use eye tracking to detect how road users seek eye contact. While these papers offer insight about eye contact seeking tendencies in the context of either drivers\u2019 or pedestrians\u2019 gaze behavior, they do not consider both in tandem, an approach which is required to form a complete picture of eye contact. After all, eye contact is a mutual phenomenon in which two people fixate on each other\u2019s eyes at the same time and both are aware of it. These papers also do not explore methods to reliably detect and operationalize eye contact.\r\nThe goal of this PhD project is to address these research gaps. The meaning of eye contact will undergo considerable change in the near future with the advent of automated vehicles which will lack a human driver who is in control. This PhD project aims to help make that transition a smooth one by: 1) Understanding eye contact\u2019s role in interactions between pedestrians and drivers, 2) Quantifying its effects on road users\u2019 behavior, 3) Understanding what eye contact means to drivers and pedestrians, 4) Determining how important it is (if at all) in road interactions, 5) Detecting and operationalizing (i.e. defining) eye contact in traffic scenarios as objectively as possible, 6) Designing methods to replace eye contact in automated vehicles, and 7) Suggesting how to use eye contact information to improve road safety in the future.", "date_created": "2020-06-15 20:32:41 UTC", "date_last_updated": "2021-02-09 02:44:22 UTC", "completion": {"total_questions": 16, "answered_questions": 16}}, {"id": 70437, "grant_number": "202007000036", "title": "Cyber Security Monitoring and Vulnerability Assessment of Cyber-Physical Power Systems", "test_plan": false, "template": {"title": "TU Delft Data Management Questions (old version, do not use)", "id": 1165855271}, "funder": {"name": ""}, "principal_investigator": {"name": "Yigu Liu"}, "data_contact": {"info": "Yigu Liu"}, "description": "The power system operation is increasingly dependent on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and Operational Technologies (OTs).
