transformation that is associated with technological breakthroughs across socio-technical systems and address societal and environmental challenges. These policies are driven by normative or political goals and differ from the traditional market failure approach that focuses on economic growth and fail to address the societal challenges. Innovation finds its true purpose in the hands of consumers and the relationship between consumers and missions is crucial for the longevity contribution to the success of the innovation. For the mission-oriented approach to tackle a challenge and for innovation to make an impact in society, demand for innovation is necessary. However, the existence of policies in the system does not ensure demand articulation, although it claims to tackle the challenge. The aspect of demand articulation has been introduced in the research, to emphasize on the need to investigate the barriers for consumption, as consumption is linked to demand. Therefore, it is important to understand consumption to explain demand articulation failures (i.e., the absence of demand) in transitions.\r\nThe research is designed to add relevance to the Mission Oriented Innovation System by diving into the case of the Dutch fashion industry and drawing insights from the case. The industry is an example of a socio-technical system that is in transition to Circular Economy (CE). There exist Mission-Oriented Innovation Policies to reach 100% circularity in the Dutch industry by 2050. Therefore, there is a need to understand what impedes consumption to better understand what impedes demand. This will be done by means of analyzing the barriers for consumption that individuals encounter, as no previous study in the context of transitions has been done. \r\nTo achieve sustainable development, sustainable consumption is an important aspect apart from efforts made on cleaner production. Sustainable consumption is constituted by buyer behavior, values and motivation towards eco-friendly products that result in less pollution during pollution. Although consumers are environmentally aware of their purchases, it is not in line with the actual market share of sustainable clothes. The increased awareness and consciousness of sustainability had a limited impact in forming purchasing decisions.\r\nFor a transition to a circular economy in the fashion industry, demand for sustainable and circular products is required. However, to create the societal demand, identifying factors affecting individual the consumption would be beneficial. However, when we look at the literature, we observe a lack of literature on consumer behavior and usage of CE business models, despite the presence of demand-side policies thereby leading to absence of demand or demand articulation failure. To solve demand articulation failures in the industry, it is crucial to identify what barriers form its root cause, as this forms important input for innovation policy. The root cause of demand articulation failures in transitions has been very little studied. It is not known what micro-level factors impede the micro-level consumption that constitutes the macro-level consumer demand. As these micro-consumption factors are not known, policies might not be effective to create demand.\r\nThe research focuses on the fashion industry, which is a demand-driven industry. Currently, the lack of circular fashion demand is a barrier towards the implementation of circular business models. Based on the research gap identified, the objective of the research is to better understand the demand articulation failure using the case-study of Dutch fashion industry that is undergoing CE transition. Despite the efforts to produce sustainable clothes, the fashion industries promoting circularity relatively make up a very small segment of the market. The study aims to identify and analyze factors influencing circular clothing consumption among Dutch consumers. Once the micro-factors obstructing the consumption behavior are identified, the factors could explain macro-level demand articulation failures. These factors would be an important input for the existing sustainable and/or circular policies in the clothing industry. This would help the policymakers to address and analyze these factors and further speed up the CE transition in the fashion industry.\r\n", "plan_content": [{"title": "Generic DMP", "description": "The DCC default template", "sections": [{"title": "Data Collection", "description": "", "number": 2, "questions": [{"text": "What data will you collect or create?", "number": 1, "format": "Text area", "option_based": false, "themes": [{"theme": "Data volume"}, {"theme": "Data format"}, {"theme": "Data description"}], "answered": true, "answer": {"text": "<p>A qualitative approach is used for the research.

Factors such as mutual solubility of solvents\r\nand metal salt concentration will be investigated thoroughly. Initially, commercially available microfluidic\r\nchips (e.g. glass YY-systems) will be used to investigate low radioactive solutions, but the switch to the\r\nmicrofluidic chips developed in this project will be made as soon as these are available.Ideally, the unused target\r\nmaterial can directly be recycled for irradiation. If traces of other compounds are present, however,\r\nunwanted by-products can be formed during irradiation. To this purpose, analytic methods need to be\r\ndetermined (i.e. mass spectrometry, gas or liquid chromatography) that detect the presence of\r\ncontaminants after the purification step. In the case of contaminations, the extraction method must be\r\nadjusted, e.g. by varying the organic solvent, the extractants or pH.After purification, the radioisotopes need to be dissolved into a\r\nsolvent matrix (aqueous medium, specified pH, acceptable buffer system) required by the clinic. This can\r\nbe done e.g. by solid phase extraction or back extraction. In this respect, quality control protocols for all\r\nisotopes need to be developed. The objective is to investigate the applicability of the newly developed microfluidic chip to the two most\r\napplied irradiation systems for medical isotopes, being the nuclear reactor and the cyclotron. Instead of\r\nfeeding single, premade radioisotopes to the microfluidic chip, irradiated liquid target material will be fed to the chips. These targets contain by-products, e.g. by radiolysis during irradiation.", "plan_content": [{"title": "NWO Data Management Plan (September 2020)", "description": "<p>This template is intended for creating a data management plan, based on the data management section that was part of your research proposal. NWO expects you to incorporate any comments received from the referees and/or the committee about the data management section in this data management plan.</p>\r\n<p>You are expected to consult with research data management support staff at your home institution for the completion of this plan. NWO strongly advises researchers to seek such support at an early stage. Plans that have not been consulted with institutional data management support staff will not be accepted.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What does NWO understand as research data?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Research data are the evidence that underpin the answer to research questions, and can be used to validate findings. Data can be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence.</p>\r\n<p>For the purpose of NWO&rsquo;s data management policy, the definition of research data does not include physical objects such as scientific and archaeological collections, physical arts works or biobanks; however, digital information extracted from such objects are to be regarded as research data.</p>\r\n<p>Software is also not included in the definition. NWO recognizes that software (algorithms, scripts and code developed by researchers in the course of their work) may be necessary to access and interpret data.

The goal of the research is to improve learning from the pre-lecture activities. In order to investigate this, you will first be asked to participate and give informed consent at the start of the course. Subsequently, you will be given a short questionnaire at the start and at the end of the course. During the course, you will be quizzed about the pre-lecture content during the lectures, as usual.</p>\r\n<p>For this research, data will be collected from the online environment (Brightspace), quizzes in the lectures, and achievements on the exams. This data will be anonymized and will only be accessible to the researchers. The choice to participate in this research will not affect the assessments of this course in any way.</p>\r\n<p>We are sure that there are no risks in participation in this research. However, in research situations, misuse is always a possibility. That is why we assure the participants that we will do everything that lies in our possibilities to ensure the confidentiality of the answers. To minimize risks we shall replace the student numbers with other numbers that will not be traceable to individual students as a person when all relevant data will be processed. This ensures and guarantees anonymity.</p>\r\n<p>Data files will be kept until then in a safe data site and approved by the ethical committee. Finally, the anonymous data will be available open-source in the Dataverse repository of LDE CEL (TU Delft, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Leiden University). When you don&rsquo;t want your data to be stored on that site, please send an email to&nbsp; [researcher]&nbsp;before the end of April 2019 in which case she can remove your data before it will be anonymized and stored in the repository.</p>\r\n<p>For questions about this study, please contact [name of researcher], email of researcher</p>\r\n<p><strong>Thank you for your cooperation,</strong></p>\r\n<p>names of researchers</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>"}}, {"text": "<h4><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"color: black;\">17.
